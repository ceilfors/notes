Nobody will open a book and wish it contains more types of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet.\n[...]\nThe biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight.\n[...]\nOne thing is for sure: the common idea that we should liberate ourselves from any restrictions and "open ourselves up" to be more creative is very misleading indeed (Dean 2013, 201).')])]),e._v(" "),r("h2",{attrs:{id:"backlinks"}},[r("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#backlinks"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Backlinks")]),e._v(" "),r("ul",[r("li",[r("a",{attrs:{href:"./Ahrens,_How_to_Take_Smart_Notes.html"}},[e._v("Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes")]),e._v(" "),r("ul",[r("li",[r("a",{attrs:{href:"./Creative_work_need_enabling_constraints.html"}},[e._v("Creative work need enabling constraints")])])])]),e._v(" "),r("li",[r("a",{attrs:{href:"./Limiting_the_length_of_your_zettels_can_make_them_atomic.html"}},[e._v("Limiting the length of your zettels can make them atomic")]),e._v(" "),r("ul",[r("li",[e._v("Constraining your notes to a certain length may sound very restrictive for a creative work like writing, but "),r("a",{attrs:{href:"./Creative_work_need_enabling_constraints.html"}},[e._v("Creative work need enabling constraints")]),e._v(".")])])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
