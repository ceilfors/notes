# Broken windows accelerates software entropy
[[Software entropy]] needs active energy to be exerted to be fought (you need energy to move hot air - fridge). Unfortunately, fighting this entropy off from teams' perspective is difficult when there is a broken window ([[Broken windows theory]]) because people feel less hopeful about the effort they put in. Worse, when neglect kicks in (resulting in more broken windows), software entropy will grow faster.

	* [[Broken windows accelerates software entropy]], therefore doing the opposite, where we have no broken, may encourages people to keep that state. People tend to give extra care as they don't want to be the person who breaks the window first.
