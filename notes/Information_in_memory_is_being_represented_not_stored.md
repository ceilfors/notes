# Information in memory is being represented not stored
In the book [[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]], the author is being very careful in using the word represented, rather than stored, when talking about the [[Long-term memory]]. This is due to the similar concern of [[The name short-term memory may emphasise too much on storage]]. Information in our memory is not stored as-is, and it may be different when you recall it in the future.
