# Attentional disorder blocks flow
A person with attentional disorder will unfortunately struggle to experience flow as their attention are fragmented. They will not be able to flood their working memory with information that are relevant at hand, because irrelevant information will involuntarily be processed ([[The prerequisites of flow are needed to flood working memory]]). The cause of attentional disorder are usually genetic, but may also be caused by childhood experiences.
