# Extrinsic motivation could undermine children’s self-motivation
Teachers, tutors, carers, or parents would typically provide stickers or pocket money to incentivise the kids to adopt new behaviours. Unfortunately, this practice may undermine children’s self-motivation.

For example, I did use stickers to encourage my then 2-year-old to brush her teeth. Prolonging this practice might have made her think that the responsibility of taking care of her teeth belongs to me, rather than hers. She’ll not have the self-motivation to brush her teeth when this happens.

Realistically speaking, though, most in things in life started extrinsically. My 6-year-old now brush her teeth without anymore stickers. See also: [[Flow activities are exotelic first before they become autotelic]]
