# Library late fees discriminate people who need libraries the most
Library late fees is a type of fine that charges people when the books they borrow are returned late. The motivation to implement the fine is to discourage late returns. Library late fees, however, induced fear to poor families, who actually need books the most. The fear unfortunately discouraged poor families to not borrow books. Even though implementing the late fee is simple, this simple decision has made the whole idea of a library to not work i.e. level the playing field to families from different socioeconomic background.

> In libraries across the country that charge fines, the poorest neighborhoods have the most number of people blocked from use. In fact, the Colorado State Library was so worried about this, they published a white paper, and they stated unequivocally that it's the fear of fines that keeps poor families out of libraries. Books level the playing field by exposing children of every socioeconomic background to words. At the library, we offer programs for adults on computer classes and job skills training, business start-ups. We do all of this great work for our community members, and at the same time, we counteract it by charging fines and fees of our patrons. Now, why would we continue to operate under a model that hurts our most vulnerable patrons the most?
