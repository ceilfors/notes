> You can also help children with memorization tasks using mnemonics. For example, you can use the bizarre name “Mvem J. Sunp” to remember the names of the planets in the solar system in order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. “King Philip came over for good soup” works well in biology class to remember the order of classification in biology: kingdom, phylum, class, order, genus, and species.
