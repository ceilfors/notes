# Observer effect may impact a complex system
This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).

* [[Types of constraints]]
	* In a product team, the presence of someone, may affect the team's behaviour. Once I turned up as a coach in a team, they said, "Now that Wisen is here, let's write tests" (See: [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]])
* [[An experiment may impact a complex system]]
	* Even more interestingly, even an observation can change a complex system. See [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]].
* [[Oblique]]
	* A more effective way to influence change in a [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]], where it has the characteristic of being vague and non-direct.
* [[Forest example for complex system]]
	* A forest is a good analogy to understand the [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]].
