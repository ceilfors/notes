# Observer effect may impact a complex system
This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).

## Backlinks
* [[Complex problem assumed order]]
	* There are differrent domains in the [[Cynefin framework]]. One of the most common mistake is to think that we're operating in an [[Ordered System]], while we're actually in a [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]].
* [[Forest example for complex system]]
	* A forest is a good analogy to understand the [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]].
* [[Oblique]]
	* A more effective way to influence change in a [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]], where it has the characteristic of being vague and non-direct.
