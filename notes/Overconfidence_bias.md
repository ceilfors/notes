# Overconfidence bias
Overconfidence bias is a type of [[Cognitive bias]] where people’s subjective confidence towards their judgements is greater than the objective accuracy of those judgements. This bias often make people underestimate a task, especially tasks that aren’t broken down. Interestingly, even the people who study this phenomenon admit they that fell for it too.

	* Sticking to a plan, however, requires willpower (Ahrens 6) and willpower is not a sustainable way to writing, especially when what you write takes a multi year of research ([[Workflow trumps willpower]]); you want to gain enjoyment from writing instead, and [[Zettelkasten enables constant focus on interesting materials]]. We have [[Overconfidence bias]] too which means our plan tend not to work out as we expected. Sticking to a plan will also disregard new discoveries (Ahrens 11). The DNA structure won't be discovered if the scientists sticked to their plan ([[DNA structure was discovered on cancer treatment research]]).
