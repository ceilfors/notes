# Well-defined workflow forms positive feedback loop
A good way to motivate ourselves is by making a progress, and a good way to know if we're making a progress is by getting a feedback. The best kind of feedback that we should look for is the feedback that we get from the work itself, which will create a feedback loop. Therefore if you define a good workflow, you will form a positive feedback loop. Because the work that you're doing will provide a positive feedback, it will in turn help you continue on your work, forming a virtuous cycle (Ahrens 52).

An attempt to form the feedback externally, not from the work itself, on the other hand is not a sustainable way to keep yourself motivated because you'll not form a feedback loop (Ahrens 52). External reward creates only a single flow, not a loop. This is a similar point to why intrinsic motivation is more sustainable than extrinsic motivation.

The zettelkasten consists of a well-defined workflow, therefore allowing the practitioners to focus on interesting and easier things. This is good to keep yourselves motivated.
