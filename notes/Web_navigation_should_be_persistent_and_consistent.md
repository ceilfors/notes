# Web navigation should be persistent and consistent
[[Effective website navigation helps navigating non-psychical space]]. Given that the users will be moving from one page to another, the navigation should also be persistent and look the same throughout their journey.

> Just having the navigation appear in the same place on every page with a consistent look gives you instant confirmation that you're still in the same site - which is more important than you might think. And keeping the same throughout the site means that (hopefully) you only have to figure out how it works once.

* [[Persistent web navigation may cause distraction]]
	* Even though [[Web navigation should be persistent and consistent]], web navigation can also be a distraction, especially when users have switched the way they think from scanning into focusing on a task ([[Websites should be designed to allow focus]]). When users are trying to focus on completing a form, for example, they may or may not intentionally click on web navigation therefore not completing the intended form. In the scenario where a persistent web navigation becomes a distraction, the web navigation should be kept to the minimum, such as just the Site ID.
