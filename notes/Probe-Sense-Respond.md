# Probe-Sense-Respond
The decision model from [[Cynefin framework]] for [[Complex domain]].

## Backlinks
* [[Safe-to-try probes]]
	* Probe is the first step from [[Probe-Sense-Respond]]. The best way to understand what a probe is is to contrast it against other verbs:
* [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]]
	* Unlike [[Ordered system]], [[Complex system]] can't be analysed for solution. An easier way to navigate a [[Complex system]] to probe then understand its [[Dispositionality]] ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]]).
* [[Probation period as an example of probing]]
	* I find probation period, in the context of hiring a new team member, to be a good example of probing ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]] / [[Safe-to-try probes]]). I like it because the words seem to share the same Latin root probare, and most people are familiar with the idea of a probation period.
