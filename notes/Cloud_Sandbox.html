The isolation protects the higher deployment environments, such the staging or production environment, to be affected by the code changes. A sandbox is also isolated only for a single developer, typically being setup in your local machine. Testing your code in a sandbox before pushing to the mainline is important, so that you can keep the mainline branch green (Continuous Integration).</p> <p>Many applications are built on the cloud, leveraging many cloud services. As sandbox environments are typically being created in developers’ local machine, it’s difficult to create a sandbox when these cloud services are not available locally. These cloud only services are not open sourced, and are fully managed by the cloud providers, like AWS S3, for example. You can’t run AWS S3 locally.</p> <p>How could you create a sandbox if you’re building a cloud-based application then? There are two approaches:</p> <ol><li>Local sandbox: Replicate the cloud services locally</li> <li>Cloud sandbox: Create your sandbox in the cloud</li></ol> <p>Replicating cloud services locally is expensive, but fortunately the open source community has put a joint effort to create <a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localstack<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>. Local sandbox is an attractive approach because of developers’ familiarity (a sandbox would normally run locally). Local sandbox also an environment that you can control, and you’ll not have to spend an extra cost as you’ll be utilising your local machine’s compute power.</p> <p>Even though you can replicate the cloud services locally, there are risks where the behaviour of these replicated services to not be the same with the cloud. These risks reduce confidence in your test. The cloud providers are also moving rapidly, which means new features might not be replicated locally yet.

This inspires confidence in testing, as it’s guaranteed that your code change will work when you push to the mainline. You will also be able to leverage the new features from the cloud services.</p> <p>Having an exactly like for like environment would also mean that it’s harder to mock the cloud services. How would you induce a failure in AWS S3, for example? A sandbox should be isolated for every developers, that means for every cloud sandbox that you provision, there’s an associated cost to that. If you normally work offline, this approach will also not work for you.</p> <h2 id="backlinks"><a href="#backlinks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Backlinks</h2> <ul><li><a href="./Cloud_Sandbox_necessitates_Infrastructure_as_code.html">Cloud Sandbox necessitates Infrastructure as code</a> <ul><li><a href="./Cloud_Sandbox.html">Cloud Sandbox</a> brings the pain of your infrastructure automation forward. Taking the example of a new product development again, the number of developers you have will scale faster than the number of deployment environments you have. It’s quite common for a team to have 4 - 6 developers, even when a product is not launched yet. Making infrastructure change manually to every sandboxes will be a pain. Cloud sandbox therefore necessitates infrastructure as code, and you should invest in infrastructure as code as early as possible.</li></ul></li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
