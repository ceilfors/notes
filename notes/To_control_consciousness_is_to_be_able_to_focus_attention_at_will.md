# To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will
The information that enters our consciousness will either make us content or discontent. This means if we want to be content, we need a gatekeeper to only allow good information to enter our consciousness. That gatekeeper is our *attention*. Attention determines whether a piece of information is something that we’d like to process, therefore we need to learn how to focus our attention at our will if we want to feel more content.

There are challenges, though, in having the ability to control our attention. We grew up building [[Attentional habits]] which are hard to change, and our attention may be demanded by goals that are not ours. We also have [[Attentional limits]]. The good news is, [[Controlling consciousness is a learnable skill]]. If we succeed at focusing our attention at our will, we would be in control of the quality of our life.

It is attention that selects the relevant bits of information from the potential million of bits available. It takes attention to retrieve the appropriate references from memory, to evaluate the event, and then choose the right thing to do. […]

* [[The treadmill of rising expectation]]
	* In the pursuit of happiness, the treadmill of rising expectation is one of the biggest cause of discontent our life. They normally come from social instruction, which in turn will abuse our genetic programming - getting us to do something that we don’t plan to do. The only way to escape this is to have the ability to control our consciousness and liberate ourselves. ([[To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will]])
* [[Meditation is a practice to control consciousness]]
	* [[Controlling consciousness is a learnable skill]], and meditation is a form of practice to control consciousness. It is a fallacy to think that meditation is a practice to empty your mind, it’s a practice that focuses your attention on something at will ([[To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will]]). Think about meditation as a gym for mental control. Yogi would meditate by focusing their attention on their breathing. Other meditation trainer would encourage meditation by focusing on counting from 1 to 10. It doesn’t seem to matter what you focus on, as long as you are training your focus.
