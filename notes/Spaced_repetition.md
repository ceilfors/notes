# Spaced repetition
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that leverages the [[Spacing effect]] and prioritises retrieval for memories that can't be retrieved well yet. This technique can be easily demonstrated by using flash cards, where information that have been retained well will be spaced out further, but harder information will have smaller spacing.
