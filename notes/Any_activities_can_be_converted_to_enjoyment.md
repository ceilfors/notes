* [[Autotelic personality]]
	* Although everyone can learn to enter the flow state ([[Controlling consciousness is learnable]]), not everyone have the same level of ability to make everything they do enjoyable. People with an autotelic personality has a greater ability to enter the flow state than an average person, they have the habit of converting everything they encounter into an flow experience ([[Flow experience is an autotelic experience]]). [[Any activities can be converted to enjoyment]]. This means, based on the [[The prerequisites of flow experience]], autotelic individuals are very good at challenge finding and skill building by themselves.
