	* After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex System]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).
