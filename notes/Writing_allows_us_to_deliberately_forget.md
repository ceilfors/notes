# Writing allows us to deliberately forget
We have [[Working memory limits]], therefore making sure that we can populate our working memory with what's relevant in the current circumstances is necessary for us to be effective. Unfortunately we don't really have a full control over what we have in our working memory, other irrelevant thoughts might linger (like open tasks) and will reduce our ability to focus. (See also: [[Zeigarnik Effect]])

We need to able to deliberately forget about the irrelevant thoughts. [[Forgetting is a healthy process of inhibiting irrelevant information]]. Writing makes us have an external system, and it will help us forget about those lingering irrelevant thoughts.

> But thanks to Zeigarnik's follow-up research, we also know that we don't actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. That's right: The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen's "Getting things done" system works: The secret to have a "mind like water" is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. And we can't take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.

> Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning.
