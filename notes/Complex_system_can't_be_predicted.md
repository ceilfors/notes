# Complex system can't be predicted
One of the symptom of [[Complex problem assumed ordered]] is to make an attempt to predict a [[Complex system]]. Unfortunately, given that a complex system has a [[Non-linear causality]], it's inherently unpredictable.

I think this is one of the reason why complex system is so hard to be understood given that as a human being, we crave and need predictability.
