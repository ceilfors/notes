# Chunking increases working memory capacity
We have [[Working memory limits]], in terms of how much we can store in our memory. How then we could process more than our limits? The answer is chunking.

[[Chunking]] allows us to increase the capacity of our [[Working memory]].

> But what if you split the numbers into these dates: 12/4/2000 and 01/01/2001? The information stays the same, but suddenly it's much easier to remember. This is known as chunking. Chunking means combining information into bigger pieces that are easier to understand.

> Mnemonics are actually just one example of a broader memory strategy having to do with organizing information. Working memory seems capable of holding onto seven “chunks” of information. A chunk is a meaningfully connected set of information. 

[[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]] (p. 135).
> Thus, if the to-be-remembered information allows "chunking," and this is recognised by the learner, than the capacity of STM can be increased.

 Chunking increases short-term memory capacity

[[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]] (p. 135).
> It is therefore possible that some people are able to store more items in their STM, not because their STM capacity is larger (i.e., more storage space) but because they use very effective control processes, often in combination with long-term memory (LTM) contents.

* [[Working memory is efficient when it stores relevant information]]
	* We have [[Working memory is limited to four chunks]]. Even though [[Chunking increases working memory capacity]], what differentiates individuals' optimum use is the relevance of information being stored there. If you can keep what you have in your head relevant, you are more efficient than others.
* [[Mnemonic may chunk memory]]
	* [[Chunking increases working memory capacity]]. Not all information can be organised in a meaningful way, therefore some type of mnemonic can be useful in that situation to introduce a chunk.
