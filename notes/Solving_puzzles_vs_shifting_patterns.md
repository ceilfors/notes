# Solving puzzles vs shifting patterns
Considering the [[Three systems through complexity science]], it's helpful to to have a different language to deal with them:
1. Solve puzzles for [[Ordered system]]
2. Shift patterns for [[Chaotic system]] or [[Complex system]]

Think about a non-ordered system to be an impossible puzzle to be solved, or there's no problem to be solved, and think about it to have a desired state instead.

When you are thinking about shifting patterns, you can also ask different questions:
1. What is the current pattern?
2. Which pattern do we want to amplify/dampen? [[Amplify or dampen to shift patterns in complex systems]]
3. What's keeping the patterns in place? [[Constraint]]
