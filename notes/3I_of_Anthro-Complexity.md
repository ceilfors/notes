# 3I of Anthro-Complexity

The three I mnemonic to acknowledge why humans different to other animals ([[Anthro-Complexity]]):

- Intelligence
  Unlike ants who can get stuck in a death spiral ([Ant mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill)), I can think for myself and get out of the spiral if I need to.
- Identity
  I can swap identities rapidly. When I write this note I'm turning into a researcher. When disrupted because I'm working from home, I instantly turn into a father or husband.
- Intent
  I can do things out of purpose rather than pure instinct. When I'm hungry, I can override it and decide not to eat. [[Consciousness is intentionally ordered information]]

> **The 3Is of Anthro-Complexity**
> Anthro-complexity starts with homo-faber (the maker), homo-ludens (the player) and homo-narrans (the storytelling animal). At the very least, this means addressing [the 3Is](https://www.cognitive-edge.com/twelvetide-2008-anthro-complexity/):
> 
> - *Intelligence* - because no matter where we stand on human cognition being embodied, embedded, enculturated and enabling, and perhaps also enacted and extended, we need to allow for reflection on experience, for [abstraction](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Abstraction) from experience, and for all else that we associate with higher levels of cognition.
> * *Intentionality* - because in recognising that how humans are attracted to different opportunities for action goes beyond responding to stimuli, Anthro-Complexity foregrounds matters relating to purpose (or priorities) in ways which highlight our facility with abstraction and which introduces deliberative choice and goal setting.
> * *Identity* - because our awareness of the fluidity in how we “show up” in different contexts, and of the way we hold lightly or tightly to any [coherence](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Coherence) we perceive in how we take things as unfolding, means those of us navigating Anthro-Complexity must delve into notions of recognition, respect and dignity in ways which we commonly find difficult to convey outside of our narratives.
