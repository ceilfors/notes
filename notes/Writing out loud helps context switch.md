# Writing out loud helps context switch
<!-- #evergreen #remotework -->
2020-05-23

When I was writing [[2020-05-22]], I was remote working from home. During that time in the morning, my 4yo was very active and would like to play with me —  I typically played with her during the pandemic from 8 am to 10 am except on a single workday that disrupt her routine.

Not only I discovered that just writing out loud in my daily log is good for brainstorming — [[To write is to rubber duck]], I also found that I could easily context switch when I need to. After I have written a couple of paragraphs, I had to play for 1 or 2 minutes with my 4yo, when I resume back, I could download all of my previously saved working memory back and start working again.
