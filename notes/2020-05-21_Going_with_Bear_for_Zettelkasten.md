# 2020-05-21 Going with Bear for Zettelkasten
<!-- #transient #tools -->

I’ve been evaluating the software that I can use to practice [[2020-05-20 Discovering Zettelkasten]].

There are three tools that I’ve tried:
- Obsidian
- Zettlr
- Bear

I did sign up for Roam Research, which is currently super hyped, but I didn’t get any invite. I ended up not waiting for it as the Markdown export apparently is not usable in other apps.

I tried Obsidian, which was still in a private beta. I can imagine that some of the note I have will contain code, and unfortunately Obsidian doesn’t support code highlighting. It might be supported if we start to tweak it, but we don’t want to delve into such details. I really like the graph that it produces to link notes, I think I will be able to use this with any other tools in conjunction though.

I tried Zettlr and I didn’t really like it. Even though the app is super suitable for Zettelkasten, as it’s designed for it, the app crashed when I first tried it. When I left it running, it consumes 500% of my CPU. 

Bear is really great. I immediately fell in love with the tool, and I have paid for it. The downside of this app is the missing automatic backlink. At some point, I would experiment with the following plugins:
- [GitHub - andymatuschak/note-link-janitor: Maintains backlink structure among interlinked Markdown notes](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor)
- [GitHub - andymatuschak/Bear-Markdown-Export: Markdown export from Bear sqlite database](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Bear-Markdown-Export)
- [GitHub - sbusso/Bear-Power-Pack: A collection of workflows enhancing Bear writer app on iOS and Mac.](https://github.com/sbusso/Bear-Power-Pack)

One of the other benefit of using Bear is I really like what Andy Matuschak has written, and he has also produced the above Bear related scripts!
