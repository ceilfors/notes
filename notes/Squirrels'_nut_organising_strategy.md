# Squirrels' nut organising strategy
Average tree squirrels can bury up to 10000 nuts every fall, and only 10% of them are not retrieved back. The strategy they use is very similar good organising practices we do:
* They use visual cues, so that they remember where their stash is
* They stash nuts by types, so that the amount of locations they have to remember is reduced

The last 10% that they have not managed to retrieve are not actually a waste, they grow as trees for their future generation. They are probably smarter than us humans.

P.S. Squirrels can pretend to bury nuts to prevent nuts theft
