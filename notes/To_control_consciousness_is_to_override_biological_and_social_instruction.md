# To control consciousness is to override biological and social instruction
Those who can control their consciousness can make themselves happy or sad regardless of what’s happening to their “external” world. By changing the content of their consciousness, they can form disaster into opportunity.

Understanding that [[Consciousness is intentionally ordered information]] is the key to control consciousness. Most of us have our intents coming either from biological instruction or social instruction. We form goals based on these instructions, such as living a long and healthy life or to get a job. As our intents are coming from a hierarchy goals, we could actually have a higher level goal up in the hierarchy that overrides those biological instruction or social instruction.

Martyrs, for example, voluntarily suffers death, an intent that are quite the opposite of the norms to live a long and healthy life. This intention is formed as they have their religious beliefs as their higher level goal.

Individuals who depart from the norms - heroes, saints, artists, and poets, as well as madmen and criminals - look for different things in life then most others do. The existence of people like these shows that consciousness can be ordered in term of different goals and intentions. Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality.
