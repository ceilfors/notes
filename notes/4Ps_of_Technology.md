# 4Ps of Technology
The 4Ps of Technology is a mnemonic to remember the role of technology in a business. Martijn Verburg shared this model where he explained how the responsibility of a CTO shifts depending on the stage of a business. The 4Ps are:

1. Platform
2. Process
3. People
4. Product

Upon researching, there are many slight variations of xPs out there. I personally prefer to use the word *product* rather than *project*.
