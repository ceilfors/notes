# Anchoring effect
Anchoring effect is a cognitive bias where an individual is heavily reliant on the first information that they get (the anchor), and compare the subsequent information they get with the first one. Many of the examples I found in the internet are about how this effect is being used on pricing and negotiation. What I'm interested in more, though, is the type of anchoring effect that is triggered when the second piece of information is not even relevant with the first one.

One of the example I found is from [BBC Two - Horizon, 2013-2014, How You Really Make Decisions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wyr3c). In this experiment, volunteers were supposed to pick up a random ping pong ball from a bag, with a number written on them. Once a ball is picked, the volunteers then asked the maximum amount they would be willing to pay for a bottle of champagne. Yes, the number on the ping pong ball and the price of champagne is completely irrelevant. The volunteers who picked up a ball with number 10, would make an offer  around £7 - £20 for that bottle of champagne. The other group of volunteers who picked up a ball with number 65, would make a maximum offer of around £40 - £80.
