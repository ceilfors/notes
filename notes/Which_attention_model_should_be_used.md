# Which attention model should be used?
[[Dichotic listening can be explained by different attention models]], but which model should be used?

Given that [[The purpose of a model is to simplify]], some models seems to be simpler to understand than other. The introduction of [[Attenuation model of attention]] for example feels very complex, but this doesn't necessarily mean that [[Broadbent's filter model of attention]] is wrong.
