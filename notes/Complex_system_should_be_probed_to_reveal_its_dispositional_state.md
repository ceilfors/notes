# Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state
Unlike [[Ordered system]], [[Complex system]] can't be analysed for solution. An easier way to navigate a [[Complex system]] to probe then understand its [[Dispositionality]] ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]]).

Let's take an example from [[Managing a children's party]]. Shout "Who wants a cake?!" as a probe, and you can see if the children are going to come round for the cakes. This will reveal the children's disposition towards cakes. The alternative of course is you can interview each children if they like cakes before offering them, which would be inefficient.

The dispositional state of human system is analogous to human desire (or intent - [[3I of Anthro-Complexity]]).

> The complexity and adaptive capabilities of a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) emerge out of the dipositionalities of the system and cannot be understood, explained or predicted in terms of linear causality or underlying causal laws. In a CAS the future state cannot be predicted but the dispositionalities indicate a set of possibilities and plausibilities.
