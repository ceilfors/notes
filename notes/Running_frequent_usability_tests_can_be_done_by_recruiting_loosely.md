# Running frequent usability tests can be done by recruiting loosely
Finding ideal users to run usability testing can get expensive. If this this means you will run less usability tests, the cost of not discovering the usability issues could end up becoming more expensive than the cost of running the test.

Instead of narrowing your recruiting scope, recruit more loosely to reduce cost therefore making it easier to run the test more frequently. You may be worried that you'll not be getting quality data, but [[Self-evident websites are designed for non-target audience]].
