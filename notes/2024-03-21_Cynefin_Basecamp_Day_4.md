[[What's the relationship of dispositional and constraints?]]
I don't get what the sis. Is Constraint what's affecting the current dispositional state?
---

[[Designing parallel safe-to-try probes]]
- See [[Constraint should be a plausible hypothesis]]
---
[[Why safe-to-try probes should be run in parallel]]
There's an answer somewhere in the recording, something
---
The reason we probe is to influence the constraint, change the pattern
---
Liminal
In between state
Phase shift
Dave Snowden talks about physics as an example here

No line in between complicated and clear
---
Need to watch recording of day 4 around CYnefin dynamic
- There are good examples around innovation, startup, research and development
- And cases where this is true

[[Blue line: Progressing to stability (Cynefin Dynamics)]]
WiFi as an example of blue dynamic
IT expert to make it work last time
Now people just send router to your house. It's reaching stability.
[[Explore-Exploit]]

---
[[Shallow dive into chaos]]
- [[Red line: Route to radical change (Cynefin Dynamics)]]
---
[[Red line: Route to radical change (Cynefin Dynamics)]]
- couldn't move to stability, throw yourself into chaos
- Need an example for this?
---
[[Purple line: The grazing dynamic (Cynefin Dynamics)]]
- Startup examples
- Resaerch
- Some people got stuck in this 
---
Cynefin dynamics of my check engine light - see email, just move the email here

---

Obliquity
---
Career path as an example of obliquity

[[Explore-Exploit]]
