# My wife was happy to move to the UK over Germany due to familiarity
After living in Malaysia for a couple of years, we had the idea to move to the UK or Germany. The move to Germany was initially easier, but my wife hesitated.

An opportunity to move to the UK was then available, she instantly bought into the idea.

[[Visualisation in great detail induces familiarity]]. She later told me that since her childhood, she always visualise herself living in London and would love to eventually move there.

We later moved to the UK without even trying to visit the country first, it was an instant move. [[Mere-exposure effect]] was at play.
