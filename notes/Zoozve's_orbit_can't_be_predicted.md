# Zoozve's orbit can't be predicted

I used to think that any moon's orbit is predictable. This is not the case for Zoozve, a quasi-moon which orbit is affected by the Sun and Venus, a [[Three-body problem]], the orbit is unpredictable and we can only predict it up to a certain point.

This is an interesting example of [[Non-linear causality]], where just by adding one more planet, suddenly astrophysicist can't predict the orbit.

> Sure. There are rules, there are definitely rules. But the thing is, Zoozve is following rules that we can never fully grasp. It's a three-way dancer, not a two-way dancer, so it's not on those predictable rails. And because of its polyamorous relationship with the Sun and Venus, it actually presents sort of a mathematical conundrum known as the three body problem.

> Yeah. It's only possible to do it for a certain amount of time. It's like, you can't predict it more than a little while out. Like, for example, we know that Zoozve is gonna leave Venus at some point.
