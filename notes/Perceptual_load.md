# Perceptual load
## Backlinks
* [[Perceptual load theory]]
	* The theory proposes that we have a limited capacity of what we can pay attention to (processing capacity), and the amount of capacity that we have will depend on the complexity of the task or stimuli we're handling ([[Perceptual load]]).
* [[Talking while driving is dangerous when the other person can not observe the traffic situation]]
	* When traffic is worsened, or there's a potential hazard, we have to switch our attention to the potential hazard and think differently. When this happens, we'll not be able to talk because the hazardous situation has increases our [[Perceptual load]].
* [[Comparing side-by-side circumvents our cognitive limits]]
	* Rather than using your working memory, put them side by side instead. This may increase your [[Perceptual load]]. This is great, because [[Distraction has low impact on tasks with high perceptual load]].
