* [[New learnings rarely start from zero]]
	* Every new knowledge that we are trying to understand will be based on top of an existing preconception ([[Hermeneutic circle]]) (Ahrens 48). Knowing this as a fact, we should not fear learning something new just because it sounds new. Our previous learning or existing skills are usually transferrable.
