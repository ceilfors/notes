# 2020-05-20 Discovering Zettelkasten
I first made a discovery on Zettelkasten when I was reading about Roam Research. These are the articles that I’m mainly going back to again and again to understand the method more:

* [Zettelkasten — How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)
* [Andy Matuschak - §Note-writing systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr)
* [Andy Matuschak - Taxonomy of note types](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6f6xgGG4NKjkA5NA1kDd46whJh2Gt5rAmfX)
* [Zettlr | “Wtf is a Zettelkasten?”](https://www.zettlr.com/post/what-is-a-zettelkasten)

Before I discovered this method, I have been approaching my reading and learning with [[Mind map]].  Unfortunately I found the mind map approach to have too much friction for my liking. First, a mind map has to be stored in a proprietary format. Second, I can’t easily add notes to the map. The way I think about the Zettelkasten method at the moment is its very similar to Mind mapping, but it’s making the note first class, and the graph second.
