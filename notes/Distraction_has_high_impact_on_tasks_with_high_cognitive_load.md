# Distraction has high impact on tasks with high cognitive load
When someone has loaded many information to their working memory, these information are not stored in their long term memory yet. When they're distracted, those information is somewhat lost.

This is the opposite to what happen when we have high perceptual load. [[Distraction has low impact on tasks with high perceptual load]].

When I got distracted, I have lost the information I was analysing. [[Distraction has high impact on tasks with high cognitive load]].
