# Interleaved learning
A method of study where we deliberately learn about different topics within a particular domain given that there is an evidence that it'll improve our performance (although it seems like this learning is effective because we need to fill our time due to [[Spacing effect]]). This is in contrast with blocked practice where we'll master a specific topic before we move on to a different domain.

In the context of software engineering, for example, we could interleave a programming language, testing, design patterns, etc, rather than mastering the specific nuance of a programming language.

The improvement of performance is attributed to the practice of discrimination between topics, problems, etc.

This idea seems to be related to [[Context switching helps when you get stuck]].

[[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]] (p. 18)
> Can we start revising another topic or would this interfere and deteriorate our performance? To answer this latter question, research suggests that intermixing different topics within a particular domain (this is called interleaving) will not deteriorate but actually improve performance! (Reedier & Pic, 2012; Rohrer, 2012).
