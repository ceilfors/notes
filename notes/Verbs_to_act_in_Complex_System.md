# Verbs to act in Complex System

After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex system]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).

1. Modulate
   - [[Complex system should be modulated instead of controlled]].
2. Probe
   - Trying things out
   - [[Safe-to-try probes]]
3. Scan
   - [[How and when should the word scan be used in Cynefin?]]
4. Shift patterns
   - [[Solving puzzles vs shifting patterns]]
5. Amplify/dampen
   - [[Amplify or dampen to shift patterns in complex systems]]
