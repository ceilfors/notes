# Verbs to act in Complex System

After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex System]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).

1. Modulate
   - [[Modulate over drive in Complex System]].
2. Probe
   - Trying things out
   - [[Safe-to-try Probes]]
3. Scan
