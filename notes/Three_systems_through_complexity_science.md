# Three systems through complexity science

It seems like there are different ways to define these three systems, look at the references below to differentiate them, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] video, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] text one, from the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], and one from the wiki.

What I have understood so far, there are characteristics that we can look at to differentiate the systems that we are dealing with: element (or agents, the word element not used in the wiki), connections, boundaries, cause and effect, and constraints.

- [[Ordered System]]
  - Connection is stable (Think of a car, take the engine off, the car won't move)
  - Boundary is well-defined
  - Cause and effect is clear
  - Governing constraints
- [[Complex System]]
  - Connection is dynamic, they can change (think people relationship)
  - Boundary is fuzzy ([[Forest example for complex system]])
  - Cause and effect is unclear (What will happen if we chop down a tree? [[Forest example for complex system]])
    - Can also be reframed as [[Non-linear causality]]
  - Enabling constraints
- [[Chaotic System]]
  - There is no connection
  - There is no cause and effect
  - There is no boundary
  - No constraints

> * ***Ordered systems****: Here the nature of the system constrains the behaviour of agents to make that behaviour predictable. There are repeating relationships between cause and effect that can be discovered by empirical observation, analysis, and other investigatory techniques. Once those relationships are discovered, we can use our understanding of them to predict the future behaviour of the system and to manipulate it toward the desired end state.*
> * ***Chaotic systems****: These are sometimes called random systems, in which the agents are unconstrained and present in large numbers. For this reason, we can gain insight into the operation of such systems by the application of statistic, probability distributions, and the like. The number and the independence of the agents allow large number mathematics to come into play.*
> * ***Complex systems****: While these systems are constrained, the constraints are loose, partial, and the nature of the constraints (and thereby the system) is constantly modified by the interaction of the agents with the system and each other; they co-evolve."*

> In the world, we find three fundamental types of systems - ordered, chaotic, and complex. At Cognitive Edge, we apply a constraint-based definition of these systems: 
> - **Chaos** no effective constraints
> * **Complex** has enabling constraints - in general is connected
> * **Order** has Governing constraints - in general is contained

	* Considering the [[Three systems through complexity science]], it's helpful to to have a different language to deal with them:
* [[Humans can behave as any of the three systems]]
	* There are three systems ([[Three systems through complexity science]]). Where does human system sit according to these three definition?
