# Autocratic parenting style
Autocratic parenting style is one of the styles of parenting that don’t give much control to their children. It’s typically associated with strict routine, lots of shouting, and with the believe that the parents would know what’s best for their children.

Children raised in this parenting style are more apt to sneak, lie, and cheat as they know that they can’t win their parents.
