# One finger movement may change the Earth's orbit

This is an interesting illustration of a [[Complex System]]. (All elements is connected is one of its attribute, see [[Three systems through complexity science]]).

Do note that Seppo Mikkola does mention after some billions of years, although it may change the Earth's orbit, it's negligible.
