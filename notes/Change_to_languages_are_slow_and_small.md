# Change to languages are slow and small
One thing I noticed after reading, [[The Outcasts of Time]], is how the languages change very slowly. Even though John travels through time every 99 years, he can still communicate.

There is a particular instance where he discovered that people started to use the word mister, which is a new word, but even then this is a spin from the word master.
