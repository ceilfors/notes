# Learn, Apply, Teach mastery cycle
The definition of the cycle is self-explanatory. I find this cycle a good reminder for me to not stop the sequence at *apply* and not share my learnings with others. Even worse, I have the tendency to stop at *learn* for the sake of learning. Remembering this cycle motivates me to keep [[Publishing notes]], or put something to GitHub to give back to the community.

This is my alternate variation of the Learn, Build, Teach cycle, which I originally discovered from Lynn Langit. I changed the word *Build* to *Apply* as much of the things I learn is not about building. I prefer the word apply as I can use it for many things, including applying a change to the software I build, applying a new technique to my writing process, but most importantly applying a new model to the way I think.

This cycle is not only emphasising the sequence of mastery, but also a goal to balance the things we do as a knowledge worker. Most of us are focused on the *doing the job* for probably 80% - 90% of our time, then only having the rest of the small time for *learn* and *teach*.

> Lynn: And I told her, I said, “Okay, you tell me that the way that I work has been helpful to you. Now it’s your turn, you learn, build, now it’s your turn to teach.” So I try to get that idea going with people. Because I think that it’s not about an age or about a degree or whatever, it’s about what you have done. And I think that that applies even to younger people. When I’ve worked with some people even in high school that have done hackathons, if they built something learn, build, teach.
