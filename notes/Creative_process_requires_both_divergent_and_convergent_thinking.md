# Creative process requires both divergent and convergent thinking
*I might mistake conflating the meaning of divergent / convergent thinking to playful / analytical thinking, it's not an idea that I fully grasped yet*

Psychologists used to associate divergent thinking exclusively to art, and convergent thinking exclusively to science. Studies have proven that both art and science requires both kind of thinking. Alternating from one type of thinking to another is the key to creativity. The [[Double diamond]] model, for example, has put an emphasis to alternate this different kind of thinking.

"On one hand, those with wandering defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that's important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both ... The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame." (Dean, 2013, 152)

	* The process of writing consists of various different kind of activities. These activities needs their own type of attention. Researching for materials, for example, requires a different kind of attention than proofreading. Researching or connecting ideas will require us to be more playful, while proofreading or copy-editing. We can't seem to be able to be playful and analytical at the same time, therefore we need to be able to switch to the right kind of attention when we need to ([[Creative process requires both divergent and convergent thinking]]). The switch from one attention to another is easier when you have a well-defined workflow. Zettelkasten embodies this workflow and make sure that the tasks are split to use both kind of attentions.
