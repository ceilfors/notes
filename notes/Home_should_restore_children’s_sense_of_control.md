# Home should restore children’s sense of control
[[Sense of control is a basic human need]]. Unfortunately, [[School reduces children sense of control]].  Given that the majority of children’s time is being spent in school, they have to have a different place where their sense of control could be balanced out.

The rest of children’s time are typically being spent at home, which the most sensible place for them to restore their perceived control. Unfortunately, many parents or carers would use [[Autocratic parenting style]] which means children won’t have the medium to fulfil their needs.

To restore children’s sense of control, adopt [[Authoritative parenting style]] and provide [[Autotelic family context]].
