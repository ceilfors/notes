See also [[The name short-term memory may emphasise too much on storage]], therefore working memory is introduced.

This new name emphasises the importance that we're not only temporarily storing information in this memory, but also manipulating information.

> Working memory, which was introduced in a paper by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), is defined as "a limited-capacity system for temporary storage and *manipulation of information for complex tasks such as comprehension, learning and reasoning*." The italicised portion of this definition is what makes working memory different from the old modal model conception of short-term memory.
