* [[Understanding requires elaboration]]
	* We often mistake familiarity for understanding. When you listen to a talk or read a book about a topic that you're familiar with, it's a mistake to think that you understand that topic. Re-reading is especially dangerous as not only you'll believe that you understand what you are re-reading, but you'll also tend to like them more due to the [[Mere-exposure effect]] (Ahrens 86).
* [[Visualisation in great detail induces familiarity]]
	* When [[Visualisation]] is applied with great detail, it may induce familiarity. This familiarity in turn will create a [[Mere-exposure effect]].
* [[My wife was happy to move to the UK over Germany due to familiarity]]
	* We later moved to the UK without even trying to visit the country first, it was an instant move. [[Mere-exposure effect]] was at play.
