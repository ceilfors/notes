# Mere-exposure effect
## Backlinks
* [[Understanding requires elaboration]]
	* We often mistake familiarity for understanding. When you listen to a talk or read a book about a topic that you're familiar with, it's a mistake to think that you understand that topic. Re-reading is especially dangerous as not only you'll believe that you understand what you are re-reading, but you'll also tend to like them more due to the [[Mere-exposure effect]] (Ahrens 86).
