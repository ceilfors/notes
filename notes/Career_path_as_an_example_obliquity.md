# Career path as an example obliquity
This is an example of [[Obliquity]] that has been given by [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] which aligned pretty well with my experience:
- If you ask anyone: "Do you think you'll be doing what you do today, 10 years ago?". The most likely answer is "No".

It underscores the idea that we live in a complex environment and we can't plan directly what we'll be doing 10 years.
