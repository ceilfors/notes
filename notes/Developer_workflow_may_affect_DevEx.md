# Developer workflow may affect DevEx
There are a lot of research that has gone into [[DevEx]] and it's centred it's  study around organisational improvements.

From engineer's point of view these organisational improvements are external factors that will improve DevEx. I believe that the workflow an engineer practice will affect DevEx too.

Following through [[The Three Dimensions of DevEx]]:
1. Feedback loops
[[Effective workflow forms positive feedback loop]]
2. Cognitive load
[[Working memory limits]]
3. Flow state
[[The prerequisites of flow are needed to flood working memory]]
