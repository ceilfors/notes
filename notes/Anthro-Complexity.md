# Anthro-Complexity

Complexity is born out of studying ants and birds.

But humans are not like ants, see [Ant Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill).

Anthro-Complexity is a type of complexity that acknowledged the inherent complexity that humans bring as compared to other animals.

[[3I of Anthro-Complexity]] indicates why humans are more complex and why Anthro-Complexity deserves a typology on its own.
