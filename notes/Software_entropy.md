# Software entropy
Software entropy applies the idea of [[Entropy]] (thermodynamics) into software, which have a similar effect to [[Technical debt]] (economics).

* [[Broken windows accelerates software entropy]]
	* [[Software entropy]] needs active energy to be exerted to be fought (you need energy to move hot air - fridge). Unfortunately, fighting this entropy off from teams' perspective is difficult when there is a broken window ([[Broken windows theory]]) because people feel less hopeful about the effort they put in. Worse, when neglect kicks in (resulting in more broken windows), software entropy will grow faster.
