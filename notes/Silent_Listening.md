# Silent Listening

Silent listening is one of the technique from [[Complex Facilitation]].

Comparing this against [[Shared single note-taking]], where we have multiple people speaking and one person taking notes, Silent Listening turns this format around, so that we only have 1 person speaking and multiple note-takers.

As a frequent single note-taking person, I found Silent Listening to be useful in preventing [[Production blocking]].

As per how I have experienced it in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], a spokesperson was appointed in a group, and the rest of the participants will then be asked to remain silent and take notes in a shared board. Although this was not done in the basecamp, it typically ends with [[The Cynefin standard questions]].
