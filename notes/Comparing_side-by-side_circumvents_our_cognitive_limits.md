# Comparing side-by-side circumvents our cognitive limits
Comparing two things are easier when what you're comparing are visible. There's a tendency for software engineers to flip their windows or screens very rapidly to compare two things and most often they can't spot the difference ([[Change blindness]]).

When windows or screens are rapidly switched, what you're doing is you're committing the details into your working memory, we have [[Working memory limits]], and which make [[Cognitive load]] higher.

Rather than using your working memory, put them side by side instead. This may increase your [[Perceptual load]]. This is great, because [[Distraction has low impact on tasks with high perceptual load]].
