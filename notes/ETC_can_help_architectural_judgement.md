# ETC can help architectural judgement
In any decision making process, it's useful to have a set of agreed decision criteria that can be used to evaluate options.

When it comes to technical design, what's important is to pick an option that's easier to change later ([[ETC]]). In absence of a good criteria, software engineers may opt for something that's more artistic ([[Peacock architecture]] [[Beaumaris architecture]]).
