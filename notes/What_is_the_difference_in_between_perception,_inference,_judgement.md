# What is the difference in between perception, inference, judgement?
This example is useful for me to understand better of the differences.

I see someone walking in with a wet umbrella:
- [[Perception]]: Someone walked in with a wet umbrella
- Inference: It must be raining outside
- Judgement: I choose not to go outside

## Backlinks
* [[Bayesian inference]]
	* In the note [[What is the difference in between perception, inference, judgement?]], I have an example of:
* [[Helmholtz's theory of unconscious inference]]
	* This is one of the [[Multiple approaches to perception]] listed in [[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]]. I got confused because it uses the word inference, see [[What is the difference in between perception, inference, judgement?]].
