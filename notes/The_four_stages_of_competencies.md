# The four stages of competencies
1. Unconsciously incompetent

The individual doesn’t know what they are not good at.

2. Consciously incompetent

The individual knows that what they’re not good at. This means they can start to learn.

3. Consciously competent

The individual learnt and know what they’re good at.

4. Unconsciously competent

The competent individual forgets about what they’re good at. Their skills become an intuition.
