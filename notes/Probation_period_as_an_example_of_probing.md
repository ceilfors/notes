# Probation period as an example of probing
I find probation period, in the context of hiring a new team member, to be a good example of probing ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]] / [[Safe-to-try probes]]). I like it because the words seem to share the same Latin root probare, and most people are familiar with the idea of a probation period.

A probation period is an excellent way to test if a new hire fits in the team. The opposite way is to fully analyse the new team member before they can join the team, which could lead to an ineffective and tiring hiring process.
