# Ron Jeffries gave up TDD to solve sudoku
Ron Jeffries, one of the founder of XP, and a practitioner of [[TDD]], was taking a challenge to solve sudoku. After 5 days of attempt, he gave up.

This story is famous because at the same time, Peter Norvik, which is another prominent figure in the computing industry has solved sudoku without TDD.

This story sometimes has been interpreted as TDD being useless, but it's worth narrowing the understanding down that TDD might not help much in a problem that requires complex algorithm.
