# My intention to buy a pushchair makes me see pushchairs everywhere
Before my daughter was born, I was made aware that I'd need to buy a pushchair. Before this awareness, or the intention for me to buy one, I swear I've not seen pushchairs around me at all.

Suddenly once this goal is set, everywhere I walked, I see pushchairs, I can see the brands, what type of it, etc.

[[Intention directs attention]].
