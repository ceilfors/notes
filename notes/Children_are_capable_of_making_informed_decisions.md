# Children are capable of making informed decisions
We always think that children will not be able to make good decisions in their life, which is why we parents should be making the decisions for them. Apparently this is a misconception because:

* By the age of 15, most of the cognitive processes would have reached the adult level to make rational decisions.
* Research shown that children at the age of 9 can make the same decision given the knowledge. ([[Lack of knowledge makes poor judgement]]).

[…] Interestingly, half of the nine-year-olds chose that option, too.[…] We think this shows not only that nine-year-olds are capable decision makers, but also that when they come up short it’s because of lack of knowledge, not necessarily judgement.

In fact, most cognitive processes reach adult levels by midadolescence.<sup>5</sup>
