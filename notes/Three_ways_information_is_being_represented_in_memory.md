# Three ways information is being represented in memory
In cognitive psychology, the ways information is being represented in our memory is called coding ([[Information in memory is being represented not stored]]). There are three types of coding:

1. Visual coding
   Example: In LTM this is when I'm visualising the school computer lab I was in when I won the typing game competition. In STM, this is when, for example, we're looking at a certain art piece.
2. Auditory coding
   Example: In LTM this is when we can remember songs. In STM, this is what facilitates conversations.
3. Semantic coding
   Example: In LTM this is when you're recollecting a concept you've read from a book last week. In STM. Placing words in a category in the current task.

All these type of codings are applicable to [[Long-term memory]] and [[Short-term memory]].
