# How and when should the word scan be used in Cynefin?

One of the theme I noticed from [[Cynefin framework]] practitioners is the use of word scan, which is pretty pervasive in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].

I scoured through the Cynefin Wiki as of Mar 2024 and couldn't find any definition of it, however, these are what I understand so far:
1. The idea of scanning is being used closely with signals. Cynefin practitioners find it especially important to scan for weak signals (a signal that would otherwise not be found without deliberately scanning). The picture of a radar comes to mind.
2. It seems that it's most used for [[Complex domain]], but it can be used to reset when we don't know in which domain we are.
3. Scanning should come before the creation of [[Safe-to-try probes]]
4. Area: In a [[Complex system]], we should scan as wide as possible to discover a better diversity of information.
5. [[Granularity]]: Framing scanning in levels of granularity is helpful. You can scan a complex system from culture of organisation (high level) all the way to human body as a complex system (low level). This allows for better information diversity.
