# Hire me
I'm an independent consultant with 8 years of tech leadership and more than 13 years of product delivery experience. I have led teams and shipped products in startups, charities, and large enterprises.

Please [contact me](mailto:hello@ceilfors.com) if you'd like to start a conversation about how I can help. You can see my recommendations on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wisen/). 

- If you're looking for permanent hire, I'll be open for it as long as you offer 4-day work week and time flexibility.
- Especially if you are not causing harm, or making positive contribution to the world, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Here are some ways I can help. I can tailor these to fit your needs:

1. **Startup coaching**. Is your startup struggling to deliver after growing to a certain size? I can help improve your engineering practices, such as TDD, CI/CD, Refactoring, and promote more collaborative team practices like pairing/ensemble programming or running a dojo.
2. **Startup advising**. Are you new to a leadership role? I can serve as a sounding board to help you form clearer thoughts and I can assist with your hiring process as well.
3. **Startup CTO**. Don't have someone to set a direction and make decisions? I can help.
4. **Software architecture**. You can catch a glimpse of how I think about architecture here:  [Open Software Design](https://opensoftwaredesign.com/upmo/) .
5. **Writing**. My writings have been featured in major publications such as  [ZDNET](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-become-a-serverless-architect/) ,  [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/08/traits-serverless-architecture/) ,  [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/LockInCost.html) , and InfoWorld, among others.
6. **Serverless**. If you need help adopting serverless technology on AWS, I can assist. I've created a serverless open-source framework that's been listed in  [Thoughtworks Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/languages-and-frameworks/laconia) .
7. **Shipping/Freelancing**. Need more hands to ship your product? I'm here to help. I am open to working with any programming language, but I'm most proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript.
