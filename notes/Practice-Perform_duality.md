- [[Performing is an exercise of maximising System 1]]
- [[Practicing is an exercise of moving from System 2 to System 1 by rehearsing]]

* [[Measuring error rates may reduce performance]]
	* [[To maximise practice time is to maximise error rates]]. But, unfortunately, carrying this habit from practice into perform ([[Practice-Perform duality]]) might be detrimental, given that it may induce frustration in a high-stake environment, forming a vicious cycle:
* [[Chunks should be borrowed from experts]]
	* Some chunks, such as "error rates", can be detrimental depending on the [[Practice-Perform duality]]. [[Measuring error rates may reduce performance]].
