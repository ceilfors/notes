# Safe-to-try probes
Probe is the first step from [[Probe-Sense-Respond]]. The best way to understand what a probe is is to contrast it against other verbs:
- Analyse: Analysis implies that we will understand the causality of what we do before we act. Given the nonlinear causality of a [[Complex system]], it's hard to analyse them. Rather than analysing, we probe to understand its [[Dispositionality]].
- Experiment: Experiment is meant to be repeatable. To prove a theory, scientists will conduct the same experiment over and over again to ensure its replicability. Probe on the other hand, won't be able to be replicated or repeated, because [[An experiment may impact a complex system]].

In complex problems, though, the side-effects mean that you might not get the impact you were hoping for, even with the effect you intended… or you might find that the effect wasn’t really what you wanted after all.

	* I find probation period, in the context of hiring a new team member, to be a good example of probing ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]] / [[Safe-to-try probes]]). I like it because the words seem to share the same Latin root probare, and most people are familiar with the idea of a probation period.
* [[Safe-to-fail probes]]
	* The new name is [[Safe-to-try probes]]. I prefer the new name to as the word try will get people to try.
