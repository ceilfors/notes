# An experiment may impact a complex system
In an [[Ordered System]], we may experiment to figure out what's the best change that we can do to a system.

Interestingly, in a [[Complex System]], the experimentation itself will induce a change to the system, therefore:

1. The experimentation itself can be an [[Oblique]] mechanism for change. [[Safe-to-try Probes]].
2. Given that the change has been done, the best change can't be derived anymore as the system has shifted.

Even more interestingly, even an observation can change a complex system. See [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]].
