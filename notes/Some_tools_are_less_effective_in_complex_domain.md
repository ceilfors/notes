# Some tools are less effective in complex domain

Overheard this saying from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]

I found this interesting given that despite my understanding of [[Bounded applicability]], I still fall to [[Complex problem assumed ordered]].

I haven't connected to the idea that some tools are not effective in complex domain. It's a good reminder that when I'm about to employ a certain tools or techniques, they might be less effective in [[Complex domain]]. This is probably why [[Complex facilitation]] is required.
