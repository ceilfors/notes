# Forest example for complex system

A forest is a good analogy to understand the [[Complex domain]].

A complex system is defined a such:
1. Dynamic connections
   - Animals, trees, plants all need each other to live.
2. Entangled causes and effects
   - Chopping one tree may not grind the forest from a halt, and you may have an unforeseen consequences elsewhere.
3. Fuzzy boundaries
   - What does the boundary of a forest end?
4. Unpredictable patterns
   - It's hard to guess what will happen next. One part of forest has lots of tall trees, another has more bushes. A forest may change in an unexpected way.
