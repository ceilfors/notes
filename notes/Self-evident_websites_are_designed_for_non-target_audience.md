# Self-evident websites are designed for non-target audience
It's a common mistake to design websites for the target audience, the domain experts. Domain experts typically would have domain specific languages, which when used would make websites harder to be understood by beginners. Even worse, the domain specific language that you have used for the design might not actually be used by other domain experts.

[[Usable websites should be self-evident and self-explanatory]], and to achieve this you'll need to design for the beginners instead. The languages used by beginners would make the website be self-evident for both the beginners and the experts.

Domain knowledge is a tricky thing, and if you design a site for money managers using terminology that you think all money managers will understand, what you'll discover is that a small but not insignificant number of them won't know what you're talking about. And in most cases, you need to be supporting novices as well as experts anyway. [...]
