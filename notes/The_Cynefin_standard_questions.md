* [[Silent Listening]]
	* As per how I have experienced it in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], a spokesperson was appointed in a group, and the rest of the participants will then be asked to remain silent and take notes in a shared board. Although this was not done in the basecamp, it typically ends with [[The Cynefin standard questions]].
