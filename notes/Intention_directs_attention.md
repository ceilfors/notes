> Intention is a funny thing, and whatever the brain puts its intention on is what it sees. Have you ever thought about buying a certain type of car and then it was as if you were suddenly seeing that exact type of car everywhere you went? Was it your intention that made the car magically appear or was it your brain's focused attention that allowed you to finally see what was in front of you all the time?
