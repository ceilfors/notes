# The number of zettels written per day is a better lead measure for learning
The amount of accessible mediums where we can learn today is unprecedented, there are more books, audiobooks, videos, podcasts, or articles than ever before. You may try to learn more by consuming all these contents, but this is a mistake because [[Understanding requires elaboration]]. Using the number of books you have read, or the number of audiobooks you have listened to, as the lead measure of your learning therefore is futile.

When you [[Write about what you read]], you'll force yourself to get a better understanding about what you're learning. Writing your zettels therefore is a better lead measure for your learning. Once you do this, you'll soon realise that you can only write so much in a day because the process of elaboration requires effort. You should also put a brake to what you consume, knowing that the process of elaboration is the only way to close your learning loop.
