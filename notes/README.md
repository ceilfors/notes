Welcome to my personal working notes. This is an ongoing project to organise my thoughts around how I'm making sense of the world I am in, which may or may not meander around programming, software architecture, startups, consulting, and leadership.

If you want to browse around my thoughts, you can look around [[Â§What's top of mind]]. Keep in mind that these are working notes, they are messy, but I hope you can find something valuable. If you see a broken link, that's probably because I'm still writing the note or my note export process is broken.

I'm quite active on ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceilfors)) if you'd like to chat with me. I also occasionally livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ceilfors), another place where you can see how I think and work.
