* [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]]
	* Let's take an example from [[Managing a children's party]]. Shout "Who wants a cake?!" as a probe, and you can see if the children are going to come round for the cakes. This will reveal the children's disposition towards cakes. The alternative of course is you can interview each children if they like cakes before offering them, which would be inefficient.
