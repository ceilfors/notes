> Short-term memory (STM) is the system involved in storing small amount of information for a somewhat longer but still brief period of time (Baddeley, Eysenck, & Anderson, 2009). Thus whatever you are thinking about right now, or remember from what you have just read, this information is in your short-term memory.

* [[How long would information stays in short-term memory?]]
	* The name [[Short-term memory]] implies that information won't live long there. But long will would information stays there?
* [[The name short-term memory gives too much emphasis on storage]]
	* The idea of [[Short-term memory]] which was initially introduced in the [[Atkison-Shiffrin Memory Model]] didn't manage to capture the importance of what the memory is being used for. I think researches during that time studies more about the storage aspect of this memory, such as how many info can we stored inside, how long will the info live, etc.
