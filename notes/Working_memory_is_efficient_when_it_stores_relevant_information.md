# Working memory is efficient when it stores relevant information
We have [[Working memory is limited to four chunks]]. Even though [[Chunking increases working memory capacity]], what differentiates individuals' optimum use is the relevance of information being stored there. If you can keep what you have in your head relevant, you are more efficient than others.

	* ## Given that we have [[Working memory limits]], negative thoughts that linger in our heads also consume that capacity, which means we'll not be able to perform as efficiently as we could ([[Working memory is efficient when it stores relevant information]])

	* [[Working memory is efficient when it stores relevant information]]. What information that goes in working memory is being controlled by our central executive (based on [[Baddeley's model of working memory]]). Therefore the ability to deploy our [[Attentional control]] can make our use of working memory be more efficient.
