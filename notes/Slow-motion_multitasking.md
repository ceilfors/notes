# Slow-motion multitasking
Most of us recognise the significant breakthrough Charles Darwin's ideas bring. We, however, often neglect how much time he needed to finally publish the writing:

- The Origin of Species: 22 years (1837 - 1859)
- The Descent of Man: 32 years (1839 - 1871)
- The Formation Of Vegetable Mold Through The Action Of Worms: 44 years (1837 - 1881)

Notice how not only these ideas took time to develop, but they were also developing in parallel. Tim Hardford calls this idea slow-motion multitasking. Slow-motion is the emphasis here as the non slow-motion mode in contrast is counterproductive ([[Multitasking is an impossible task]])

Niklas Luhmann has also demonstrated pattern where it took him 29.5 years to finally publish "The Society of Society", whilst working on other ideas simultaneously in his slip-box. ([[Luhmann always worked on something easier and interesting]])

Authors, who are [[Slow-motion multitasking]], also switched context when they got stuck. In the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-what-do-you-do-when-you-get-stuck), 54.4% of the respondents would *Do other work and come back later* when they got stuck; considering that this is the highest option after *Visit Stack Overflow*, it is quite a significant number. Context switching, therefore, can be helpful when you get stuck. If getting stuck is unproductive, then context switching is *not always* harmful for productivity.
