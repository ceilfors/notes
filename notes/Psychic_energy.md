# Psychic energy
Psychic energy is a form of energy that we use to think, remember, make decisions, etc. The best way to think about what psychic energy is is to compare it to a better known form of energy: physical energy. To write this note, Iâ€™ll have to spend my physical energy to move my fingers and spend my psychic energy to think about my writings.

> Because attention determines what will of will not appear in consciousness, and because it is also required to make any other mental events - such as remembering, thinking, feeling, and making decisions - happen there, it is useful to think of it as psychic energy. Attention is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy.

* [[Attentional habits]]
	* Attentional habits are the [[Psychic energy]] that we spend not by our own intention. Attentional habit could formed by either biological or social instructions. [[Cognitive bias]] bias is probably a good example of how our attention could be spent not consciously by our choice. [[Zeigarnik Effect]], for example, would take our attention to unfinished tasks.
* [[Personality trait is the pattern of attentional habits]]
	* Given there are two people with different personality traits in a party, the extrovert would typically be energised after socialising, while the introvert would normally end up quite exhausted. These two different personality traits differ in how they decide to spend their [[Psychic energy]]. The extrovert has the [[Attentional habits]] to look for enjoyment with others, the introvert decide to spend their energy to avoid danger or being self-conscious all the time.
* [[The key to flow is to control consciousness]]
	* Making new information congruent with your goal is difficult. We live with biological and social instruction which may cause psychic disorder in our consciousness, and may trap us in [[The treadmill of rising expectation]]. Dealing with such disorder will deplete our [[Psychic energy]], which is essential for experiencing flow ([[The difference between pleasure and enjoyment is the amount of psychic energy spent]])
