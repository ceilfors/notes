# Multitasking is possible when we have extra capacity
[[Multitasking is an impossible task]], but it is achievable when the conditions permit it.

For example, I'm able to safely drive and have a conversation at the same time. However, [[Talking while driving is dangerous when the other person can not observe the traffic situation]].

From this example, there are two factors that make multitasking possible:
1. The difficulty of the task: [[The ability to divide attention depends on difficulty of the task]]
2. How well-practised the task is: [[The ability to divide attention can be achieved with practise]]
