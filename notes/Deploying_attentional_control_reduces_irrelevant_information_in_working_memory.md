# Deploying attentional control reduces irrelevant information in working memory
[[Working memory is efficient when it stores relevant information]]. What information that goes in working memory is being controlled by our central executive (based on [[Baddeley's model of working memory]]). Therefore the ability to deploy our [[Attentional control]] can make our use of working memory be more efficient.

This idea is related to the idea from flow: [[To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will]].
