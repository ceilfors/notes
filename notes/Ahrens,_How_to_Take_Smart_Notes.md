# Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes
Ahrens, Sönke. *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers*. CreateSpace, 2017

- [[Writing makes thinking possible]]
	- We need a workflow for note-writing, because [[Workflow trumps willpower]]
	- Evergreen note-writing works because [[Well-defined workflow forms positive feedback loop]]
	- [[Luhmann always worked on something easier and interesting]]
		- [[Context switching helps when you get stuck]] 
		- [[Evergreen note-writing enables constant focus on interesting materials]]

- [[Documentation is the side effect of thinking]]
- [[Writing digitally may reduce understanding]]
- [[DNA structure was discovered on cancer treatment research]]
- [[Evergreen note-writing disregards planning]]
- [[Evergreen note-writing requires a balanced routine]]

- [[Zettels should not have ephemeral tags]]
- [[Zettels should capture an atomic concept]]
- [[Limiting the length of your zettels can make them atomic]]
- [[Creative work need enabling constraints]]
- [[Write about what you read]]
- [[The number of zettels written per day as a better lead measure for learning]]

[[Praising for being smart tend to motivate people to be protective of that impression]]

In progress: 

- Therefore [[Zettels must have links]]

- §Why meetings don't work - Does workshops really work?
	- Read more here as well: [Why Group Brainstorming Is a Waste of Time](https://hbr.org/2015/03/why-group-brainstorming-is-a-waste-of-time)
		- Wow lot's of new material here, Social loafing, Social anxiety, Regression to the mean, and production blocking
	- Do not brainstorm for a topic p25
	- "In oral presentations, we easily get away with unfounded claims. We can distract from argumentative gaps with confident gestures or drop a casual "you know what I mean" irrespective of whether we know what we meant. In writing, these manoeuvres are a little too obvious. It is easy to check a statement like: "But that is what I said!" . p85
	- > It makes things worse that we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of the, irrespective of their actual relevance (Strack and Mussweiler 1997). And before you now wonder if it would be a good idea to overcome the limitations of brainstorming by assembling a group of friends to brainstorm together, forget it: More people in a brainstorming group usually come up with less good ideas and restrict themselves inadvertently to a narrower range of topics (Mullen, Johnson, and Salas 1991). p.134
		- This can be counterreacted
		- Is workshop only useful because... Consultancy?
	- There is also a reference to this in Theory of Constraints audiobook, where the daughter of the author asked his daughter that's a psychologist, on how to influence people in a meeting. His daughter isn't it obvious? There's already an experiment for this where people tend to agree with more people who have given the wrong answer.
		- Found it! [Famous Social Psychology Experiments](https://www.verywellmind.com/famous-social-psychology-experiments-2795667)
		- [Asch conformity experiments - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments)

- Unintuitively / Preconceieved / preconception of writing
	- title: Zettelkasten is not widely adopted because it is too simple for a complex problem
	- Great outcome requires great effort, is wrong p 16
	- zettelkasten not being picked up because
		- Neglect that workflow is required
			- you need to make time for any routine you introduce
				- [[Time is a universal constraint]]
		- Most people don't expect much from simple ideas p 18

- Good way to organise things 
	- Similar to architecture, Kon mari?
	- "Optimise for search and context" p42
		- It is not surprising that my friend has a book shelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show
	- "Organise for retrieval, not storage" .. ?
		- This is so good... Do we have any other quotes for this?

- You learn from what you already know
	- [[New skills are built as a sum of other skills]]
	- Hermeneutic circle p48
		- "Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle." - p48
		- This is a very interesting concept. Basically some says: if you want to understand a whole, you have to understand its parts, to understand its parts, you have to understand a whole.
			- It reminded me of how to read a book book, don't get stuck in one section, but move through and read on, then come back, this has proven to be useful for how to take smart notes



- Writing is a self feedback loop p55
	- "The same goes for writing permanent notes, which have another feedback loop built-in: Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions".  P55

- Zettelkasten works because it breaks things into smaller
	- [[Humans are constrained by biological limits]]
		- We have a limited focussed attention, and breaking down things smaller will help us gain focus. Read more at p60
	- "The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces us to shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable time before moving on to the next one." p60
		- This is similar to the idea of breaking down tasks in JIRA.

- There are many types of attention, breaking task into smaller chunks will us utilise different types of attention
	- 	- [[Effective tool circumvents human limits]]
		- Therefore to have an effective tools  we need to understand our limits (how we think, learn and, generate ideas) p20
	- "having trouble finding the right topic is the symptom of the wrong attempt to rely heavily on the limitations of the brain, not the inevitable problematic starting point, as most study guide insinuate" p50
	- This is also a [[Humans are constrained by biological limits]]
		- we can't multi task p58
	- Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking - p 29
	- [[TDD chunks memory]]
		- "Proofreading, formulating and outlining are also different from the task of combining and developing thoughts. Working with the slip-box means playing with ideas and looking out for interesting connections and comparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clusters and preparing the order of notes for a project. Here, we need to puzzle with notes and find the best fit. It is much more associative, playful and creative than the other tasks and require a very different kind of attention as well." p62
	- "In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed." p63
		- Creative people need both kind of attention, more Dean, 2013, 152 and Vartanian 2009, 57 reference p 63
			- childlike minds, analytical, 
			- wide open playful mind vs narrow analytical frame
		- This is similar to software design as well, or double diamond,

- Zeigarnik effect p70
	- Open tasks will occupy short term memory more p70
	- Q: Is this the same with working memory? What's the difference between working memory and short term memory
	- Zeirgarik: We don't have to finish the task to let it go from the brain, just write it down!
		- [[To resume flow, stop in the middle]]
	- GTD mind like water - make space for new information by writing things down p70
	- Optimise shower thought, write things less important, don't write important things p71

- Walking helps thinking
	- "To have a walk (Ratey, 2008) or even a nap supports learning and thinking"

- When is a good time to hypothesise?
	- In "how to take smart notes", Sonke argues that a hypotheses will induce confirmation bias. p79
	- This idea conflicts with hypothesis driven development, does that mean that hypothesis driven development is bad? When is the right context to have a hypothesis? Does Cynefin help?
	- "The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually no even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. P79
	- "If on were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasons that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration" (Nickerson 198, 175) - p79
	- Zettelkasten reverses this notion, you find argument to support something, not finding the argument to support the other thing
	- Best scientist are not free from it, the counter this by "acknowledging" that they are aware and they do something about it
		- Similar to Culture map "French's saying": Once you know the sickness, you're halfway to cure
	- "The linear process promoted by most .... Start with hypothesis ... is a surefire way to let information bias run rampant" p80
	- Reflecting back, it seems like when we start a product development with a hypotheses, not only we'll have confirmation bias, but we'll have a sunk cost fallacy as we'll start the development in parallel. 
		- There are many things in product development that utilises hypothesis, like LVT, or lean start up


- The learning fallacy p88-89
	- Teachers putting attempt to make learning easier. It's like fast food.
		- Don't understand why a structure makes student dumber
	- students attempt to do cramming
		- "If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act"
	- Go and play ping pong, reduce stress, which inhibits learning process. Also it helps transfer info into long term memory (rate 2008)(garam 2008) p89


- Forgetting is not a bad thing
	- I always concerned about forgetting as my wife seems to remember more stuff than me.
	- it allows us to transfer ideas and facilitate long term learning p99
	- the whole story about sheresvsky is a very interesting notes! Take that as an evergreen note p99
	- forgetting is the erection of mental barrier, so that we can focus on the moment, otherwise we'll be having associateastion, etc etc, we won't be able to focus on our surroundings (MacLeod, 2007) p99

- The importance of mental models
	- [[§Why TDD works]]
	- Lots of material at page 118
		- Lot's of references to Charlie Munger
		- "If you only have a hammer, everything is nail"
		- "A really wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation themes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others - especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile "mental models" that can be used in different situations. "
			- What does this mean?? This contradicts a lot
			- Conflict with Bloom's Taxonomy of understanding? Don't you have to learn first? Or is it really a conflict?
			- Does this conflict with learning from failure?

- Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something" (Steve jobs)
	- Many references in TED Radio Hour for creativity here!

- All changes are small, therefore search for the small differences
	- [[All changes require marginal adjustment]]
	- Other post: Big changes in an illusion?
	- "Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realisation, anyway, but incremental steps toward improvement. Even groundbreaking paradigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in the right direction instead of one big idea. This is why the search for small differences is key" p122

- When is it a good idea to defer, and when is it a good idea to start small?
	- If we start a product development by applying all the things that we know, it might be a waste.
	- It seems like things that require practices, need to be started early, but things that can be scanned by robot, does not.
	- Practices are things that we have to question ourself every time, "Is this important?" Is this test important?
	- This is similar to the idea of how to take smart notes
		- > We don't need to worry about the question of what to write about because we have answered the question already - many times on a daily basis. Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not. -- p134
		- > If we accompany every step of our with the question, "What is interesting about this? " and everything we read with the question, "What is so relevant about this that is it is worth nothing down?" We do not just choose information according to our interest -- p137

- Software estimation doesn't work due to overconfidence bias
	- the whole story at p142, where students estimation on when they'll finish their paper is always wrong
	- This has been cracked in the software industry though, where you have to break things down into something smaller.
		- "Just break it down" -- more motivational, estimatable, progress, etc
	- (Buehler, Griffin and Ross 1994)
	- Even the people who study this phenomenon, which is called the overconfidence bias, admit that they too fall for it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff)

- Do we need literature notes?
	- More explanation at p24 and convention at p30
	- Since we are capturing evergreen notes with references section already, literature notes seems optional
	- Andy Matuschak's thoughts: [here](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr?stackedNotes=z2Eg5jPPg8nBJWLGqJwNo5d15TAoEAXamYV7n&stackedNotes=z5nyVpkrLxYNNfRcsFfLGyYoGEwvC5qaiFogQ&stackedNotes=z2D6w86eKLuVdmk5icMJ5L6av1nG62HaF7ref)

## Weak references
- The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles (Ahrens 9)

- The idea of abstraction
	- Analogy, transference of idea through different fields, etc
	- This is quite a root post, constraints will depend on abstraction
