# Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes
Ahrens, Sönke. *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers*. CreateSpace, 2017

- Why zettelkasten works
	- Zettelkasten has a workflow, and [[Effective workflow forms positive feedback loop]]
		- Workflow works because [[Workflow trumps willpower]]
	- [[New learnings rarely start from zero]]
	- Also [[Zettelkasten is not widely adopted because it is too simple for a complex problem]]
	- [[Zettelkasten splits tasks to use different attention types]]
- The benefit of zettelkasten
	- [[Writing makes thinking possible]]
		- [[Understanding requires elaboration]], and writing is an act of elaboration
		- [[Elaborate in writing to test your understanding]]
	- [[Zettelkasten disregards planning]]
	- [[Zettelkasten enables constant focus on interesting materials]]
		- Focusing on various interesting materials will increase context switch, and [[Context switching helps when you get stuck]] 
	- [[Writing allows us to deliberately forget]]
	- [[Zettelkasten helps counter confirmation bias]]
- The principles needed for zettelkasten to work
	- [[Zettelkasten requires a balanced routine]]
	- [[Find writing topic in your zettelkasten]]
	- [[Zettels should be optimised for retrieval strength]]
	- [[Write about what you read]]
		- 	Watch out for: [[Writing digitally may reduce understanding]]
	- [[The number of zettels written per day as a better lead measure for learning]]

## Unsorted
- The problem with cramming pp. 88-89
	- "If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act"
	- Exercise reduces stress, which inhibits learning process. Also it helps transfer info into long term memory.

## Weak references
- The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles (Ahrens 9)
- We could utilise Zeigarnik effect to solve crucial problems whilst running errands (by not writing them down). (Ahrens 71)
