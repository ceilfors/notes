# Spacing effect
Spacing effect is the phenomenon when learners encode more information to their long-term memory when their study sessions are spaced out.

* [[Interleaved learning]]
	* A method of study where we deliberately learn about different topics within a particular domain given that there is an evidence that it'll improve our performance (although it seems like this learning is effective because we need to fill our time due to [[Spacing effect]]). This is in contrast with blocked practice where we'll master a specific topic before we move on to a different domain.
* [[Spaced repetition]]
	* Spaced repetition is a learning technique that leverages the [[Spacing effect]] and prioritises retrieval for memories that can't be retrieved well yet. This technique can be easily demonstrated by using flash cards, where information that have been retained well will be spaced out further, but harder information will have smaller spacing.
* [[Spacing and interleaving]]
	* A method of learning that leverages [[Spacing effect]] and [[Interleaved learning]].
