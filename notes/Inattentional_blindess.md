# Inattentional blindess
A [[Cognitive bias]].
## Backlinks
* [[Distraction has low impact on tasks with high perceptual load]]
	* Based on the [[Perceptual load theory]], we have a limited capacity on our attention. If there's a complex information that we need to perceive, that may consume all of our attention, therefore us not notice distraction (we can't notice it, e.g. [[Inattentional blindess]]).
* [[Attention limits]]
	* [[Inattentional blindess]]
* [[Heuristics as the positive framing for biases]]
	* ## We have many [[Cognitive bias]]. Bias is typically associated with something negative, as in, we have a flaw in our heads. Take [[Inattentional blindess]], for example, where we are not able to see what we are not paying attention to. This may sound like a problem to be solved, but you could frame it positively as a [[Heuristic]], i.e. our brain is being efficient, we take only the information we're paying attention to.
