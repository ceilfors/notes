* [[Distraction has low impact on tasks with high perceptual load]]
	* Based on the [[Perceptual load theory]], we have a limited capacity on our attention. If there's a complex information that we need to perceive, that may consume all of our attention, therefore us not notice distraction (we can't notice it, e.g. [[Inattentional blindess]]).
