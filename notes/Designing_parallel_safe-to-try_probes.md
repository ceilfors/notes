Once there is a hypothesis of what [[Constraint]] keeping a pattern in place, you can begin designing a [[Safe-to-try probes]].

Design 3 probes in parallel, see an example in the reference section.

> Example:
> **Challenge**: A person in the team has a fear to get things wrong
> **Hypothesis**: I believe that if we put everyone else working remotely we will make the person has less fear
> **Describe your probe (what could you learn or shift in the system?)**: Put everyone to work virtually for 1 week
> **1. What changes will we monitor for impact?** Check-in with the team if it's having an effect in psychological safety.
> **2. Signs of success (how might we amplify)** People contributing more equally in a group setting.
> **3. Signs of failure (how might we recover)** Person still feels they can't speak up.
> **4. What could be potential unintended consequences?**  Everyone else become quieter. Team becomes resentful because they have to change thing due to one person (was good before).
