# Forgetting is a healthy process of inhibiting irrelevant information
You may associate forgetting as something bad, like a memory loss. Even though forgetting sounds like something that you'd like to cure, forgetting is actually a healthy process that you'd like to keep. Forgetting is the process of our brain inhibiting the information that are irrelevant in the current moment. Imagine having all of the information that is irrelevant to us in our mind, we'll not be able to focus on anything at all.

[[Solomon Shereshevsky]] is a famous figure for this topic. He is having a difficulty to forget. Even though not being able to forget has brought an amazing feat, not having the ability to inhibit irrelevant information may had affected his daily life more than the benefit of not forgetting.
