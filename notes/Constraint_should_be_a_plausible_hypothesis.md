# Constraint should be a plausible hypothesis
When you're thinking about what [[Constraint]] are at play in a [[Complex system]], you have to generate thoughts. These constraints don't need to be proven, you can think about them as a hypothesis.

For example, if you're resolving an issue of someone who's not engaging well in a team meeting, a constraint that "could" be at play is "leader always right culture". You may not know if that's right, but it could be right, and that's enough to generate more ideas for [[Safe-to-try probes]].
