# 2020-05-20 ShuHaRi

I first discovered this methodology from Simon Wardley’s tweet. *I couldn’t find the tweet anymore*. There are two key takeaways for me:
- imitate or copy a new technique before you try to modify the technique that you’re learning
- imitate first before you learn about the theory behind it

The entire wikipedia page [Shuhari - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) is such a nice rabbit hole, it links to many other models such as the [Bloom’s taxonomy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy).

When I was trying to tidy this note up, funny enough, I found an article from Martin Fowler: [ShuHaRi](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html). I find his description better than what I found in the Wikipedia page. He also mentioned other model from Clark Terry’s:  [Imitate, Assimilate, Innovate](http://jazzadvice.com/clark-terrys-3-steps-to-learning-improvisation/) .

```
The idea is that a person passes through three stages of gaining knowledge:
* **Shu:** In this beginning stage the student follows the teachings of one master precisely. He concentrates on how to do the task, without worrying too much about the underlying theory. If there are multiple variations on how to do the task, he concentrates on just the one way his master teaches him.
* **Ha:** At this point the student begins to branch out. With the basic practices working he now starts to learn the underlying principles and theory behind the technique. He also starts learning from other masters and integrates that learning into his practice.
* **Ri:** Now the student isn’t learning from other people, but from his own practice. He creates his own approaches and adapts what he’s learned to his own particular circumstances.
