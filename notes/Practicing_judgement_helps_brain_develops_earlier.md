# Practicing judgement helps brain develops earlier
Executive control system is one of the major part of our brain systems that helps in making decisions. Unfortunately,  [[Executive control system matures in early thirties]], and there are many decisions that an individual have to make before they hit their thirties.

Rather than waiting until an individual is 30 years old, help the brain develops earlier by making the individual make more decisions.

> When you are given room to make your own decisions, it allows you to feel in charge in other contexts. The brain is learning to make hard choices and protecting itself from the stress of feeling helpless. It is also benefitting from the internal motivation that comes from autonomy. The more experience kids have of managing their own stress and overcoming their own challenges, the more their prefrontal cortex will be able to regulate their amygdala.
