# Compare and contrast to break pattern entrainment
Over our career, we will go from one team from another. Upon joining a new team, we may have the tendency to pitch to influence a change.

A change typically is a new idea, and we tend to pitch new ideas and take about the upside and downside of it. Pitching, however, as an approach is too direct and non-effective in my experience. 

Here's a more [[Oblique]] approach to [[Influencing without authority]]:

It roughly looks like this:
1. Show all the patterns that all participants know of
2. Reflect and use [[Compare and contrast key questions]]
3. Listen intently to what people are thinking and let people generate their own interpretation and leanings.

One important principle is to avoid [[Premature convergence]], therefore, don't talk about pro/cons immediately when an idea is shown.

One of the examples I recall being done recently:
1. Compare  [[Deployment Pipeline]] / [[Trunk-based Development]] against [[Feature branches]].
2. Compare Domain specific errors against Application level errors
