Judgement, or a decision making is a competency. When an activity is defined as a competency, it implies that it can be improved by practice and experience.

They need practice. They need to experience the natural consequences of their choices, ranging from being uncomfortably cold when they decided not to wear a coat, to getting a bad grade on a test because they decided not to study.
