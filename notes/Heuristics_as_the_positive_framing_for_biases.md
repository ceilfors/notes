# Heuristics as the positive framing for biases
We have many [[Cognitive bias]]. Bias is typically associated with something negative, as in, we have a flaw in our heads. Take [[Inattentional blindess]], for example, where we are not able to see what we are not paying attention to. This may sound like a problem to be solved, but you could frame it positively as a [[Heuristic]], i.e. our brain is being efficient, we take only the information we're paying attention to.
