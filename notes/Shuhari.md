# Shuhari
Shuhari describes 3 stages to mastery: Shu, Ha, and Ri. I first discovered this Shuhari from [Simon Wardley’s tweet](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1259795847279230976). According to Shuhari, a student will go through 3 stages to master a skill:

1. Shu: To obey. In this stage, the student will copy the teacher rigorously. The student must not modify what’s being taught to ensure solid foundation.
2. Ha: To break free. The student may start to break free from the fundamentals and the rigid teaching in this stage. The student will start to ask a lot of “Why” to understand the underlying principles better.
3. Ri: [To set free](https://web.archive.org/web/20081119122929/http://www.shuhari.com/site/view/ShuharisMeaning.pml). The teacher will finally set the student free from all the rules, so that they can seek their independence. The student will learn and progress through self-discovery.

What I find interesting from Shuhari is the sequence of stages described, where students are emphasised to copy first before making an attempt to understand, because copying is how children naturally learn.

Martin Fowler has also written a [bliki](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html) on Shuhari. He shared a different model of mastery from Clark Terry’s:  [Imitate, Assimilate, Innovate](http://jazzadvice.com/clark-terrys-3-steps-to-learning-improvisation/).
