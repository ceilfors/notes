# Retrieving memories makes them easier to retrieve
In the context of learning, we can read and learn a lot for a certain material, storing them in our long-term memory. These memories are easier to be retrieved again in the future when you make an attempt to retrieve the memory (also called [[Testing effect]]).

Retrieving the memory can be easier when you have a mechanism for it, such as making the time to review what you've learnt, or perhaps creating cues for it ([[Remembering can be improved by deliberately creating cues]]).
