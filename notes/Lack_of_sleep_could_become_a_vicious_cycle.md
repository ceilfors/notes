# Lack of sleep could become a vicious cycle
We will be more tired when we don’t sleep enough. When we are tired, our [[Executive control system (brain)]] will not function well, therefore our sense of control will be weakened. This means we won’t be able to resist binging yet another Netflix or YouTube series, which will make us sleep less again. Rinse and repeat.

> Because your sense of control is weakened by a lack of sleep, the more tired you are, the harder it is to get yourself to go to bed, and the more tempting it is to just stay where you are and watch one more episode of Homeland. Your ability to inhibit your YouTube binge-watching habit or to stop yourself from checking your phone evaporates.
