# Semantic memory
The type of long-term memory for facts or knowledge. It's associated with the act of knowing without the need of mental time travel like the [[Episodic memory]].

For example, I can recall the estimated fact of Indonesia's population, which is around 270 million, but I don't really know where this fact came from or when it's the first time I learned about it, nor me requiring to have a mental time travel to retrieve that fact.
