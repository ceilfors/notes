# Visual hierarchy helps scanning
[[Websites should be designed for scanning]]. Visual hierarchy helps users scan a web page by visualising how the web elements are being organised. Imaging how hard would it be to scan a book without chapters, headings, or any font weight difference, where all the text look the same.

These are the traits of visual hierarchy that can be optimised for scanning:

* Prominence. The more important an information is, the more prominent the element should look. This can be done, for example, by enlarging a text.
* Grouping. Web elements that are logically interrelated to each other must be grouped visually.
* Nesting. Child information should be visually contained together in a parent container. Example: products being sold in a e-commerce should have their product name, description, and price visually together.
