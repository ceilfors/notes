# Use heuristics as a constraint
In a [[Complex system]], hard and fast rule is not effective. Defining a comprehensive rules that will work for 100% of the time will be too costly and will overly constrained a system, preventing the system from generating emergent patterns. A [[Heuristic]] on the other hand would typically be a single sentence and a more cost effective [[Constraint]] to be applied.
