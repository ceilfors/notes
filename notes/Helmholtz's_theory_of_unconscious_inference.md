# Helmholtz's theory of unconscious inference
This is one of the [[Multiple approaches to perception]] listed in [[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]]. I got confused because it uses the word inference, see [[What is the difference in between perception, inference, judgement?]].

Based on this approach, Helmholtz theorise that we perceive objects unconsciously based on our past experiences. This idea seems to be the related to [[System 1]].

Also associated with the likelihood principle.
