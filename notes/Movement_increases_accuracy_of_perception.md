# Movement increases accuracy of perception
[[Perception]] and movement are linked, the more you move the more you can increase the accuracy of your perception.

> Although movement adds a complexity to perception that isn't there when we are sitting in one place, movement also helps us perceive objects in the environment more accurately. One reason this occurs is that moving reveals aspects of objects that are not apparent from a single viewpoint.
