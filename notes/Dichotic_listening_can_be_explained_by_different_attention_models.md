# Dichotic listening can be explained by different attention models
I was having a difficulty to understand why [[The evolution of model to understand attention]] and how each of the model can be used.

Dichotic listening is an exercise that has been used in many experiments to understand our attention model better. This exercise involves a person wearing a headset, having two different sounds playing on different ear. The task is for the person follow the instruction on which ear they should attend to.

In this process, we'll notice that the participant can understand what's being articulated more in their attended ear, but less in the unattended one.

- [[Broadbent's filter model of attention]] or [[Information-processing approach]]
The participant could not hear what's being said in the unattended ear because it's been filtered. Our attention is effectively filtering out the information from our unattended ear.

- [[Perceptual load theory]]
The participant could not hear what's being said in the unattended ear because they have fully utilised their processing capacity for the attended ear.
