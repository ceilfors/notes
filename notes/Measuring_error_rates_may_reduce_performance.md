# Measuring error rates may reduce performance
[[To maximise practice time is to maximise error rates]]. But, unfortunately, carrying this habit from practice into perform ([[Practice\/Perform duality]]) might be detrimental, given that it may induce frustration in a high-stake environment, forming a vicious cycle:

1. Expected to execute a high performance
2. Seeing errors, frustration
3. Reduced performance
4. Back to 1

You can easily spot this cycle happening to athletes in competitions.
