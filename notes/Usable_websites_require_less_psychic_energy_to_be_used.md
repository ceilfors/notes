# Usable websites require less psychic energy to be used
Users will typically be coming into your websites to accomplish a certain task. The easier it is for your websites to be used, the less [[Psychic energy]] is going to be used by the users. When the more psychic energy is needed, users will get frustrated and leave.

This is why [[Web usability is achieved by designing for the intended attention types]]. Adding long instructions, for example, will drain the users energy unnecessarily ([[Self-evident websites do not need instructions]]).
