# Five whys
You have to find the root cause of the problem to fix a design problem. When a root cause of a problem is not fixed, you’ll noticed that you’ll be fixing only the symptoms of the root cause.

The Five whys method, developed and used by Toyota Production System, attempts to discover the root cause of a problem by repeating the question “Why?”. The number 5 is not a hard rule, its a guideline for you not to give up too early.

When you’re using this method, be explicit with your reason and intention — that you’re trying to find the root cause of a problem. This method might be ineffective if you come across to be difficult or condescending.

> Repeatedly asking questions can annoy people a slight bit, so it’s good to have the reference to the Toyota Production System handy to highlight that it’s a widely adopted and useful technique instead of you just being difficult. It’s also helpful to remind your counterparts that you are not challenging their work or competent but that your job requires you to understand systems and problems in detail so you can spot potential gaps or misalignments.
