# The difference between pleasure and enjoyment is the amount of psychic energy spent
The difference between pleasure and enjoyment is the amount of [[Psychic energy]] spent on an activity. Pleasure normally is a passive activity. When you watch a TV, for example, your brain doesn’t have to work as hard as when you’re reading.
