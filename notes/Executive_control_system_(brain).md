* [[Executive control system matures in early thirties]]
	* [[Executive control system (brain)]] (the prefrontal cortex), is only mature when you hit your thirties.
* [[Lack of sleep could become a vicious cycle]]
	* We will be more tired when we don’t sleep enough. When we are tired, our [[Executive control system (brain)]] will not function well, therefore our sense of control will be weakened. This means we won’t be able to resist binging yet another Netflix or YouTube series, which will make us sleep less again. Rinse and repeat.
