# Cynefin drew from multiple disciplines is to align reality and perception

We often have a conflict of what we perceive and the things that exist, the [[Cynefin framework]] attempts to let you see this through multiple disciplines:

1. Epistemology
   How we know things.
2. Ontology
   The nature of things.
3. Phenomenology
   How we perceive things. See also [[Perception]].
