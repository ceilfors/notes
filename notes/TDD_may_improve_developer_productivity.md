# TDD may improve developer productivity
[[Developer workflow may improve DevEx]], and [[Improving DevEx increases developer productivity]].

Using [[The Three Dimensions of DevEx]]:
1. Feedback loops
	- Making red tests turn green.
2. Cognitive loads
	- Chunks abstraction of testing, user needs, design, refactoring, programming, into different chunks.
3. Flow state
	- The prerequisite of flow state is smaller goals, and TDD helps with that.
