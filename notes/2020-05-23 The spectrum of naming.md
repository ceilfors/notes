# 2020-05-23 The spectrum of naming
<!-- #transient #naming -->

We opened a package today from Little Cooks Co. It’s one of the 4 subscription box that we have for our 4yo during the pandemic. In the middle of the project, our 4yo had decided that she’s not really interested. Funny enough, I was actually the one that is quite engaged with the project, even when the subscription box is named, or labelled for kids.

Should the subscription box wants to target me, they could make their name to be more descriptive, for example, healthy and easy cooking subscription box. This means the subscription box would be able to target two types of market, me, who’s bad in cooking, but may have fun cooking them anyway. And it’ll target parents. The problem with descriptive name though, is many people wouldn’t know if they need it if it’s a new idea. It seems that many things that still have an unambiguous use case will try to target one market. 

On the other hand, a product like papers for example, people wouldn’t try to describe what is it for.

It seems that we may fall into the [[Wardley Map]] spectrum here. Where products are entering the industrialised state, describing what is it for is less important as people would know it already. Where products are still in genesis, you tend to describe really well on one of its use case.
