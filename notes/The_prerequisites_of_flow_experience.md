# The prerequisites of flow experience
Redirect to [[The components of flow experience]]

## Backlinks
* [[The prerequisites of flow are needed to flood working memory]]
	* The [[The prerequisites of flow experience]] are needed to enable continuous concentration on a task. These prerequisites are seemingly related to the fact that we have [[Working memory limits]].
* [[Narcissism blocks flow]]
	* A person who is self-conscious is worried about what other thinks of them. When they are faced with a hard challenge, they will not be able to focus on applying their skills, which is [[The prerequisites of flow experience]], as most of the attention and energy is spent on protecting the self.
* [[Creative work requires clear goals and feedback to become a flow activity]]
	* Creative work is inherently challenging and require skills, which is one of the [[The prerequisites of flow experience]]. Creative works are normally open-ended and they donâ€™t inherently have clear goals and immediate feedback, therefore creative works are unfortunately not a flow activity by default. Writing, for example, may last for more than a week or year without clear finish line nor feedback.
* [[Autotelic personality]]
	* Although everyone can learn to enter the flow state ([[Controlling consciousness is learnable]]), not everyone have the same level of ability to make everything they do enjoyable. People with an autotelic personality has a greater ability to enter the flow state than an average person, they have the habit of converting everything they encounter into an flow experience ([[Flow experience is an autotelic experience]]). [[Any activities can be converted to enjoyment]]. This means, based on the [[The prerequisites of flow experience]], autotelic individuals are very good at challenge finding and skill building by themselves.
