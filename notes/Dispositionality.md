# Dispositionality
I was originally confused by the word disposition, as the word disposal is associated with the act of throwing things away.

To further confuse myself, I take any words that that's prefixed with "dis" to have an opposite meaning, which not always necessarily be the case.

What I've found useful in understanding disposition is to accept the fact that it has a different meaning through the evolution of language.

- Position: More static. The location of something.
- Disposition: More dynamic. The tendency of something to move in a certain direction.

Rather than thinking about the prefix "dis" to be the opposite of something, apparently the word "dis" can also mean to spread. So I can think of a disposition as the spread of something into a certain location.
