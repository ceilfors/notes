# Complex problem assumed ordered
There are differrent domains in the [[Cynefin framework]].

One of the most common mistake is to think that we're operating in an [[Ordered system]], while we're actually in a [[Complex system]].

There's a tendency to also finding a silver bullet when you assume [[Ordered system]].

> Some organizations and companies make assumptions of order more often than acknowledging complexity. For other organizations, it may be the opposite. They may operate in a much less structured or constrained way at a cost of a valid need for order and structure. Thinking about organizations your most recent experiences are with, reflect on the Poll question below, and select an answer that most closely relates to your current experiences as a whole.

* [[Bias to action could be a disease in complex domain]]
	* A symptom of [[Complex problem assumed ordered]]. Assuming order in a meeting, for example, people have the tendency to want clarity and non-ambiguity, people want solution and answers.
* [[Managing a children's party]]
	* One of the most popular metaphor in understanding [[Complex problem assumed ordered]].
* [[Complex system can't be predicted]]
	* One of the symptom of [[Complex problem assumed ordered]] is to make an attempt to predict a [[Complex system]]. Unfortunately, given that a complex system has a [[Non-linear causality]], it's inherently unpredictable.
* [[Retrospective coherence should not be used for a complex domain]]
	* This tendency to use retrospective coherence could be a symptom from [[Complex problem assumed ordered]].
* [[Some tools are less effective in complex domain]]
	* I found this interesting given that despite my understanding of [[Bounded applicability]], I still fall to [[Complex problem assumed ordered]].
