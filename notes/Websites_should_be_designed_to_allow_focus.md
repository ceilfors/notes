# Websites should be designed to allow focus
There are normally a lot of stakeholders who's involved in deciding what should go in a website. These stakeholders will have their own incentives and goals, which will cause a lot of clutter in a website. Even though [[Websites should be designed for scanning]], there are other parts of a website where the priority should be helping users complete their tasks. For example, when a user is trying to complete a checkout in an e-commerce website, they have made a decision on what they'd like to do. In this situation, scanning is no longer the mode of their thinking, and we should design the web pages in a way that reduce distraction.

* [[Persistent web navigation may cause distraction]]
	* Even though [[Web navigation should be persistent and consistent]], web navigation can also be a distraction, especially when users have switched the way they think from scanning into focusing on a task ([[Websites should be designed to allow focus]]). When users are trying to focus on completing a form, for example, they may or may not intentionally click on web navigation therefore not completing the intended form. In the scenario where a persistent web navigation becomes a distraction, the web navigation should be kept to the minimum, such as just the Site ID.
