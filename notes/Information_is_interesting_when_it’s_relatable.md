# Information is interesting when it’s relatable
[[What makes something interesting?]]. Maybe the best way to answer this question is to understand what information is not interesting. A piece of information is not interesting when it’s you have fully understood it, or it’s not relevant at all to you. If I tell you that the earth is round, you probably won’t find that interesting because it’s something that you have known. If I talk about software architecture to my 3-year-old, she probably won’t find that interesting because she wouldn’t be able to relate.

You can think about two of the examples above as an opposite extreme of a spectrum, therefore something is interesting when a piece of information is falling in the sweet spot of that spectrum. It’s something that you can relate to, but you haven’t fully grasped it yet. You may find them relevant to you because of your personal goal or to your previous experience.
