# Controlling consciousness is a learnable skill
Just because [[Consciousness]] is not something that we could tangibly see, it doesn’t mean that they’re not trainable (Similar to relative pitch ear training). Many discipline or culture have proven how controlling consciousness can be learnt. Yoga is a good example of a discipline that involves or requires the mastery of consciousness. The fact that yogi are able to do them after years of practice is no different to how a software developer could create softwares after years of practice.

The yogi, similarly, is a virtuoso of the control of consciousness. Like all virtuosi, he must spend many years learning, and he must keep constantly in training. […] The skills he yogi gains are at the expense of the more mundane abilities that other people learn to develop and take for granted. What an individual yogi can do is amazing - but so is what a plumber can do, or a good mechanic.

* [[To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will]]
	* There are challenges, though, in having the ability to control our attention. We grew up building [[Attentional habits]] which are hard to change, and our attention may be demanded by goals that are not ours. We also have [[Attentional limits]]. The good news is, [[Controlling consciousness is a learnable skill]]. If we succeed at focusing our attention at our will, we would be in control of the quality of our life.
* [[Meditation is a practice to control consciousness]]
	* [[Controlling consciousness is a learnable skill]], and meditation is a form of practice to control consciousness. It is a fallacy to think that meditation is a practice to empty your mind, it’s a practice that focuses your attention on something at will ([[To control consciousness is to be able to focus attention at will]]). Think about meditation as a gym for mental control. Yogi would meditate by focusing their attention on their breathing. Other meditation trainer would encourage meditation by focusing on counting from 1 to 10. It doesn’t seem to matter what you focus on, as long as you are training your focus.
