# Context increase advice relevance
Once I gave my mentee the wrong advice. I gave them plenty of tactics to execute, without realising that they're only a few weeks in the job. I now draw a rough influencing sphere to understand where they are, how long they're in the job, etc. As a result, my advice shifted to get the person to empathise and listen, and focus on building allies.

Advice pretty similar to taking judgement, which intern need a more accurate perception to be effective. To increase the more accurate perception, move around (ask varying questions). [[Movement increases accuracy of perception]].
