* [[Complex problem assumed ordered]]
	* One of the most common mistake is to think that we're operating in an [[Ordered system]], while we're actually in a [[Complex system]].
* [[Safe-to-try probes]]
	* Analyse: Analysis implies that we will understand the causality of what we do before we act. Given the nonlinear causality of a [[Complex system]], it's hard to analyse them. Rather than analysing, we probe to understand its [[Dispositionality]].
* [[Complex domain]]
	* Sometimes being used interchangeably with [[Complex system]].
* [[How and when should the word scan be used in Cynefin?]]
	* Area: In a [[Complex system]], we should scan as wide as possible to discover a better diversity of information.
* [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]]
	* Unlike [[Ordered system]], [[Complex system]] can't be analysed for solution. An easier way to navigate a [[Complex system]] to probe then understand its [[Dispositionality]] ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]]).

* [[Verbs to act in Complex System]]
	* After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex system]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).
* [[Solving puzzles vs shifting patterns]]
	* Shift patterns for [[Chaotic system]] or [[Complex system]]
* [[Constraint should be a plausible hypothesis]]
	* When you're thinking about what [[Constraint]] are at play in a [[Complex system]], you have to generate thoughts. These constraints don't need to be proven, you can think about them as a hypothesis.
* [[Complex system can't be predicted]]
	* One of the symptom of [[Complex problem assumed ordered]] is to make an attempt to predict a [[Complex system]]. Unfortunately, given that a complex system has a [[Non-linear causality]], it's inherently unpredictable.
* [[One finger movement may change the Earth's orbit]]
	* This is an interesting illustration of a [[Complex system]]. (All elements is connected is one of its attribute, see [[Three systems through complexity science]]).
* [[Retrospective coherence should not be used for a complex domain]]
	* Due to the [[Non-linear causality]] in a [[Complex system]], it's dangerous to assume that we can use [[Retrospective coherence]].
* [[Use heuristics as a constraint]]
	* In a [[Complex system]], hard and fast rule is not effective. Defining a comprehensive rules that will work for 100% of the time will be too costly and will overly constrained a system, preventing the system from generating emergent patterns. A [[Heuristic]] on the other hand would typically be a single sentence and a more cost effective [[Constraint]] to be applied.
