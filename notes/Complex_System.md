* [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]]
	* This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).
* [[Three systems through complexity science]]
	* [[Complex System]]
* [[An experiment may impact a complex system]]
	* Interestingly, in a [[Complex System]], the experimentation itself will induce a change to the system,  which emphasises interconnectedness of the agents, therefore:
* [[One finger movement may change the Earth's orbit]]
	* This is an interesting illustration of a [[Complex System]]. (All elements is connected is one of its attribute, see [[Three systems through complexity science]]).
* [[Verbs to act in Complex System]]
	* After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex System]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).
