# Shared single note-taking

The format of this meeting will look like this:
1. Multiple people speaking
2. One person taking notes and share their screen

This is a traditional approach in meeting where you'd typically have a note taker, and this person will contribute less to the meeting.

The note on the screen is useful for participants to check what's been discussed so far.

* [[Silent Listening]]
	* Comparing this against [[Shared single note-taking]], where we have multiple people speaking and one person taking notes, Silent Listening turns this format around, so that we only have 1 person speaking and multiple note-takers.
