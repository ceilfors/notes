# Only one type of attention can be given to one thing at one time
[[Humans are constrained by biological limits]], and we are also limited to how we can use our attention:
- We can only give our attention to one thing at a time
- We can only utilise one of our many kinds of attention at one time

> Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again.

> All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.

* [[Zettelkasten splits tasks to use different attention types]]
	* The process of writing consists of various different kind of activities. These activities needs their own type of attention. Researching for materials, for example, requires a different kind of attention than proofreading. Researching or connecting ideas will require us to be more playful, while proofreading or copy-editing. We can't seem to be able to be playful and analytical at the same time ([[Only one type of attention can be given to one thing at one time]]). The switch from one attention to another is easier when you have a well-defined workflow. Zettelkasten embodies this workflow and make sure that the tasks are split to use both kind of attentions ([[Effective workflow should break tasks down by attention types]]).
* [[Multitasking is an impossible task]]
	* Not only we can only pay attention to one task at a time, we can also only utilise one of our many types of attention at one time ([[Only one type of attention can be given to one thing at one time]]). These two limitations render multitasking as an impossible task.
* [[Effective workflow should break tasks down by attention types]]
	* [[Effective tool circumvents human limits]], therefore we have to understand what limit we are faced with if we want to make a workflow more effective. Especially in a creative work, [[Only one type of attention can be given to one thing at one time]]. Given the limit of attention we have, an effective workflow should break task down into smaller chunks by different attention types.
