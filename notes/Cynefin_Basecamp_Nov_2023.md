# Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023

A course from The Cynefin Co: https://thecynefin.co/events/?_events_categories=basecamps

Original brief:
> Virtual Cynefin® Basecamp is an immersive experience of complexity, introducing participants to the application of the Cynefin framework and its tools and methods through first-person participation. Currently offered in a highly engaging virtual environment, this course is a “must do” learning opportunity for those new to complexity and Cynefin®. For those who are well-read in the subject but want to refresh their knowledge, this course offers an opportunity to engage with others in learning about Cynefin practices in today’s context.

* [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]]
	* This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).
* [[How and when should the word scan be used in Cynefin?]]
	* One of the theme I noticed from [[Cynefin framework]] practitioners is the use of word scan, which is pretty pervasive in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].
* [[3I of Anthro-Complexity]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Three systems through complexity science]]
	* It seems like there are different ways to define these three systems, look at the references below to differentiate them, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] video, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] text one, from the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], and one from the wiki.

* [[Types of constraints]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Anthro-Complexity]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Compare and contrast key questions]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Verbs to act in Complex System]]
	* After studying Cynefin through [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] and [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], it becomes obvious that there are different verbs that practitioners are deliberately using to act in [[Complex system]], with the intention to reflect the complex attribute (like [[Non-linear Causality]]).
* [[Bias to action could be a disease in complex domain]]
	* First heard being framed as a disease from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Forest example for complex system]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Complex facilitation]]
	* A body of work containing technique. I first discovered this from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Designing parallel safe-to-try probes]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] | Day 4
* [[A system should be ready for change before being changed]]
	* In coaching: Coaching a team member that doesn't want to be coached. The system is not ready, there's no point forcing the coaching to happen. ([[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]])
* [[Career path as an example obliquity]]
	* This is an example of [[Obliquity]] that has been given by [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] which aligned pretty well with my experience:
* [[Cynefin domains can be derived from emotions]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Cynefin practitioners prefer hexagonal sticky notes]]
	* One of the interesting thing I discover from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] is the [[Cynefin framework]] seems to prefer the hexagonal sticky notes.
* [[Humans can behave as any of the three systems]]
	* Think of an operating theatre where everyone behave like machines with clear roles (First heard from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]])
* [[Linear Cynefin]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Paving desire path as an example of probing for dispositionality]]
	* However, the idea of [[Dispositionality]] though can feel very abstract. In the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], the example used is the idea of a desire path.
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Retrospective coherence should not be used for a complex domain]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Safe-to-fail probes]]
	* Learnt from the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] that the term Safe-to-fail probes have been giving an issue in some organisations as they don't like the word failure.
* [[Should Cynefin be seen from a subjective or an objective lens?]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Silent Listening]]
	* As per how I have experienced it in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], a spokesperson was appointed in a group, and the rest of the participants will then be asked to remain silent and take notes in a shared board. Although this was not done in the basecamp, it typically ends with [[The Cynefin standard questions]].
* [[Some tools are less effective in complex domain]]
	* Overheard this saying from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Traffic congestion as an example of granularity]]
	* I first understood the idea of [[Granularity]] and how useful it is through examples provided in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].
* [[Traffic control as an example of constraints]]
	* There are many [[Types of constraints]]. One good example that has been presented in the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] is traffic control systems.
