# Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023

A course from The Cynefin Co: https://thecynefin.co/events/?_events_categories=basecamps

Original brief:
> Virtual Cynefin® Basecamp is an immersive experience of complexity, introducing participants to the application of the Cynefin framework and its tools and methods through first-person participation. Currently offered in a highly engaging virtual environment, this course is a “must do” learning opportunity for those new to complexity and Cynefin®. For those who are well-read in the subject but want to refresh their knowledge, this course offers an opportunity to engage with others in learning about Cynefin practices in today’s context.

* [[Complex Facilitation]]
	* A body of work containing technique. I first discovered this from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Observer effect may impact a complex system]]
	* This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).
* [[Bias to action could be a disease in complex domain]]
	* First heard being framed as a disease from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Anthro-Complexity]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[3I of Anthro-Complexity]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Three systems through complexity science]]
	* It seems like there are different ways to define these three systems, look at the references below to differentiate them, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] video, one from the [[Cynefin 101 Getting Started]] text one, from the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], and one from the wiki.

* [[Forest example for complex system]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Humans can behave as any of the three systems]]
	* Think of an operating theatre where everyone behave like machines with clear roles (First heard from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]])
* [[Linear Cynefin]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Should Cynefin be seen from a subjective or an objective lens?]]
	* [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]]
* [[Silent Listening]]
	* As per how I have experienced it in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], a spokesperson was appointed in a group, and the rest of the participants will then be asked to remain silent and take notes in a shared board. Although this was not done in the basecamp, it typically ends with [[The Cynefin standard questions]].
