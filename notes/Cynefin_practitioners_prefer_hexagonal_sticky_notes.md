# Cynefin practitioners prefer hexagonal sticky notes
One of the interesting thing I discover from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] is the [[Cynefin framework]] seems to prefer the hexagonal sticky notes.

In contrast to square stickies, people have the tendency to create spreadsheet.

Hexagonal stickies are also nicer to work with on a table.

Hexagonal stickies when generated seems to make some organic.

It seems that this could be an essential tool for [[Complex Facilitation]].

Based on my experienced in the basecamp, square stickies has only four sides, the connection to other stickies therefore is reduced.
