# Paving desire path as an example of probing for dispositionality
[[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]].

However, the idea of [[Dispositionality]] though can feel very abstract. In the [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]], the example used is the idea of a desire path.

A desire path looks like this (from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesirePath/comments/e3oqrg/the_identical_desire_path_path_is_forged_whenever/)):

As you can see here, the architect has crated a path, but people's desire (disposition) created a different path.

An architect, however, can reverse their sequence. Rather than paving a path first, you can reveal the desire path, then pave it ([[Sequence is a crucial attribute of a process]]). Another example from [reddit: The Oval walkways at Ohio State University were paved based on the students' desire paths
