# The failure to ban coffee
Coffee houses had been a popular place for people to meet up since the 1500s.

Coffee was banned in Mecca in 1511 as the government feared that it'll become a place for people to gossip about the government ([[Characteristics of resistance to innovation]]). Many coffee houses were closed, supplies were burned, and people got beat up if they had coffee.

This ban didn't last for a year as the government was overruled by Sultan of Cairo, who was a coffee drinker himself.

In 1525, Mecca's coffee houses were banned again. The person who introduced this ban died the next year, and coffee houses reopened again.

The resistance to coffee is not only happening to Mecca but to many other countries too.

It became a law that if a man failed to provide coffee for his wife, that was grounds for divorce.
