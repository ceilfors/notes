I started to do things differently today, and started to write my thoughts at the <a href="./2020-05-22]]_daily_log._This_frictionless_writing_in_a_daily_log_is_part_of_my_workflow_from_[[My_note_writing_system.html">2020-05-22]] daily log. This frictionless writing in a daily log is part of my workflow from [[My note writing system</a>. This exercise helped me think clearer. It reminds me of the experience that I get from rubber ducking someone to solve a programming problem.</p> <p>The note that I took is not at all a tidy writing, it’s my running thought written in text format. It’s very similar to what I’m doing when I practice <a href="./free_writing.html">free writing</a>. I ended up having a better discussion with our product owner and able to present to him a clear architectural options and trade offs. These notes are then converted into options and captured as an ADR.</p> <p>I felt quite stuck before I began the free writing exercise. The reason I felt overwhelmed is, I think, because there are too many variables I’m playing in my head. It seems like I was hitting the limit of my working memory. By writing them down, it’s as if I have more working memory to play with.</p> <h2 id="backlinks"><a href="#backlinks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Backlinks</h2> <ul><li><a href="./Compare_technical_solution_with_business_language.html">Compare technical solution with business language</a> <ul><li>I was designing <a href="https://strategy.upmooffices.io/decisions/0008-introduce-aggregate-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the technical solution for the dynamic aggregate problem<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, it occurred to me that it’ll be useful if I can weigh the solutions more effectively by myself.
