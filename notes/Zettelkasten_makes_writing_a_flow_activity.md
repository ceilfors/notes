# Zettelkasten makes writing a flow activity
Writing is a creative work, and [[Creative work requires clear goals and feedback to become a flow activity]]. Writing may take up weeks or years, and it’s hard to know if you’re making a good progress without goals and feedback. If you practice Zettelkasten, you can set your goal up by writing an X number of zettels per day. Luhmann, for example, was estimated to write six notes a day.

Not only the number of zettels of written per day is great to make writing a flow activity, but also [[The number of zettels written per day is a better lead measure for learning]]

> Luhmann’s slip-box contains about 90,000 notes, which sounds like an incredibly large number. But it only means that he wrote six notes a day from the day he started to work with his slip-box until he died.
