Retrieval-based learning is a type of practice that makes learning more effective by leveraging this idea: [[Retrieving memories makes them easier to retrieve]].

The results of the experiment by Reedier and Karpicke (2006), showing how groups who studied more will perform better initially, but worsen over time.
