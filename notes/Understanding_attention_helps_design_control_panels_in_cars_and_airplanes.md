> For example, the notion that a selective attention filter mechanism (as Broadbent suggested) prevents a lot of information from reaching our awareness has a serious impact on how we should build control panels in cars and airplanes and/or how we could best design safe traffic situations (e.g., Theeuwes & Van Der Horst, 2017).
