# Semantic memory might be the context-less version of episodic memory
One of the property of [[Semantic memory]] is we could recall a fact, concept, or knowledge without time travel. One way to think about where semantic memory comes from is that they were previously represented as [[Episodic memory]], but over time, the context were removed.

Not all semantic memories are created through episodic memories (I don't understand enough).
