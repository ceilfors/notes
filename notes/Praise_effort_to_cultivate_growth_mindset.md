> To encourage a growth mindset, Dwek recommends praising effort and the various strategies kids use to solve problems, rather than their built-in ability. Say things like, “Your curiosity is really fun for me to see” over “You’re so smart”; or “I’m really impressed with how hard you worked on that test” instead of “Fantastic grade!” In Dwek’s words, “ a focus on inner effort can help resolve helplessness and engender success.”<sup>3</sup> A growth mindset is the MVP of the self-motivated child.
