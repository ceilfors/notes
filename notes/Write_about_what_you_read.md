# Write about what you read
[[Understanding requires elaboration]], therefore if you want to understand what you read, you'll have to elaborate. Writing is one good way to elaborate what you read. Writing about what you read may sound like a lot of work, but if you don't deliberately elaborate, the time that you have dedicated for reading is also going to be wasted. You have to think about writing about what you read as a process to close the loop of your learning. If that's not enough, double the benefit of your writing by organising them well so that your note-writing is not going to be wasted (for example by adopting a method like Zettelkasten).

	* The core intention of practicing Zettelkasten is so that you can connect and build on top of other concepts, generating insights. To make this happen, naturally, every notes that you write should be oriented around a concept. Capturing notes by concept will also force you to elaborate what you have read ([[Write about what you read]]).
