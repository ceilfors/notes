# Cynefin domains can be derived from emotions
Having been thinking through the [[Cynefin framework]], I realised I'm in the [[Confused domain]] when I'm feeling confused.

I can associate each domain with an emotion too, for example:
1. Clear: boring, certain, safe
2. Complicated: frustration, agreement, curiosity
3. Complex: uncomfortable, humility, creativity, impatience
4. Chaos: anxiety, adrenaline, panic

> One of the exercises asked the following questions:
> 1. Come up with examples for each domain: How does it feel to be in that domain? When have you been there? How does it feel when it's "working" well? How does it feel when it's not working? What happens? What happens towards the boundaries?
> 2. Populate the framework using these feelings - how do different location feel. What are positive aspects of being there, negative aspects?
> 3. How do you act? The sensing, the decision making, the action - how does that work in each domain? Can you give examples for each domain?
