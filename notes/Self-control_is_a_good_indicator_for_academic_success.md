> Interestingly, about 10 years after the original marshmallow study, Mischel and his colleagues looked again at the children in the initial study, using a variety of surveys for both the subjects and their teachers. They also obtained access to records of the childrenâ€™s grades. What Mischel found was unexpected and amazing. Those who, as 5-year-olds, managed to wait longer before eating the first marshmallow, tended to be more competent teenagers than their peers who ate the marshmallow after only a relatively short delay.

While willpower is an answer to self-discipline or self-control, willpower is a resource that depletes quickly hence is not a sustainable way to perform the tasks at hand (Ahrens 2).
