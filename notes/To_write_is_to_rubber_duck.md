# To write is to rubber duck
<!-- #evergreen #writing #thinking -->

I was presented with a technical challenge to improve our search experience. I started to do things differently today, and started to write my thoughts at the [[2020-05-22]] daily log. This frictionless writing in a daily log is part of my workflow from [[My note writing system]]. This exercise helped me think clearer. It reminds me of the experience that I get from rubber ducking someone to solve a programming problem.

The note that I took is not at all a tidy writing, it’s my running thought written in text format. It’s very similar to what I’m doing when I practice [[free writing]]. I ended up having a better discussion with our product owner and able to present to him a clear architectural options and trade offs. These notes are then converted into options and captured as an ADR.

I felt quite stuck before I began the free writing exercise. The reason I felt overwhelmed is, I think, because there are too many variables I’m playing in my head. It seems like I was hitting the limit of my working memory. By writing them down, it’s as if I have more working memory to play with.
