# To write is to rubber duck

I was presented with a technical challenge to improve our search experience. I started to do things differently today, and started to write my thoughts at the [[2020-05-22]] daily log. This frictionless writing in a daily log is part of my workflow from [[My note writing system]]. This exercise helped me think clearer. It reminds me of the experience that I get from rubber ducking someone to solve a programming problem.

The note that I took is not at all a tidy writing, it’s my running thought written in text format. It’s very similar to what I’m doing when I practice [[free writing]]. I ended up having a better discussion with our product owner and able to present to him a clear architectural options and trade offs. These notes are then converted into options and captured as an ADR.

I felt quite stuck before I began the free writing exercise. The reason I felt overwhelmed is, I think, because there are too many variables I’m playing in my head. It seems like I was hitting the limit of my working memory. By writing them down, it’s as if I have more working memory to play with.

* [[Compare technical solution with business language]]
	* I was designing [the technical solution for the dynamic aggregate problem](https://strategy.upmooffices.io/decisions/0008-introduce-aggregate-api.html), it occurred to me that it’ll be useful if I can weigh the solutions more effectively by myself. Unfortunately I find it to be difficult when I contemplating the choice by myself. [[To write is to rubber duck]] is really helpful, but it wasn’t enough for me to weigh the choice.
* [[Writing out loud helps context switch]]
	* Not only I discovered that just writing out loud in my daily log is good for brainstorming — [[To write is to rubber duck]], I also found that I could easily context switch when I need to. After I have written a couple of paragraphs, I had to play for 1 or 2 minutes with my 4yo, when I resume back, I could download all of my previously saved working memory back and start working again.
