# To write is to rubber duck
I was presented with an architectural problem, and couldn’t really think clearly on what my options are. As I’m experimenting with my [[Note-writing system]], I started to pour down my thoughts into my daily log. To my surprise, after writing for roughly 1 hour, I progressed really well and got down into a solution. This revelation reminds me of the experience that I got from rubber ducking debugging.

Perhaps, one reason I felt stuck is because there are too many variables I’m playing in my head when I was presented with the architectural problem. I was hitting my [[Working memory limits]]. By writing them down, it’s as if I have more working memory to play with. [[Writing makes thinking possible]].

The note that I took is not at all a tidy writing. It’s my running thought that has been presented in text format. It’s very similar to what I’m doing when I practice free writing. These really messy notes are then sanitised into an ADR.

* [[Compare technical solution with business language]]
	* I was designing [a technical solution](https://www.upmo.dev/decisions/0008-introduce-aggregate-api.html), and I couldn’t weigh the options effectively by myself. [[To write is to rubber duck]] is really helpful, but it wasn’t enough for me to weigh the options I have come up with. Normally in this situation, I would grab my colleague and start to brainstorm.
* [[Writing out loud helps resume flow]]
	* Not only I discovered that just writing out loud in my daily log is good for self-brainstorming ([[To write is to rubber duck]]), I also found that I could easily context switch, and resume my flow once I’ve played with her. I could download all of my previously saved working memory back, which is my notes, and start working again.
