# Constraint
A system has observable behaviours. Constraints are what inform and shape those behaviours.

> While we often focus on the collective behaviors of a system, the "constraints" of that system inform and shape that behavior. Constraints shape a system by modifying its phase space (its range of possible actions) or the probability distribution (the likelihood) of events and movements within that space.

* [[Types of constraints]]
	* One of the best way to understand the types of [[Constraint]] is to elaborate them by examples, these are my examples of physical and mental/knowledge. The official definition is best defined in the references.
* [[Solving puzzles vs shifting patterns]]
	* What's keeping the patterns in place? [[Constraint]]
* [[Constraint should be a plausible hypothesis]]
	* When you're thinking about what [[Constraint]] are at play in a [[Complex system]], you have to generate thoughts. These constraints don't need to be proven, you can think about them as a hypothesis.
* [[Designing parallel safe-to-try probes]]
	* Once there is a hypothesis of what [[Constraint]] keeping a pattern in place, you can begin designing a [[Safe-to-try probes]].
* [[Use heuristics as a constraint]]
	* In a [[Complex system]], hard and fast rule is not effective. Defining a comprehensive rules that will work for 100% of the time will be too costly and will overly constrained a system, preventing the system from generating emergent patterns. A [[Heuristic]] on the other hand would typically be a single sentence and a more cost effective [[Constraint]] to be applied.
