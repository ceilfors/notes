# Storing information externally is not a new idea
Writing is a mechanism for us to store information externally and it affects our memory process. The idea of storing information externally itself is actually not new. Historically, before the invention of books, we stored information externally in other people. When we need to access a certain information, we will rely on people with the expert knowledge.

> As a final remark, storing information externally (thus not in our brain), is actually nothing new. Before the invention of computers we stored information in books, and before that time, we could rely on people with expert knowledge who we could visit in the case that we wanted to know something.
