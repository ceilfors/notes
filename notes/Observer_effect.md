# Observer effect
The idea that a system can be impacted when it's being observed.

I first learnt about this from quantum physics, and realised that I encountered this issue years ago in Java (Posted a StackOverflow question: [How to reduce heap usage impact from VisualVM?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17028168/how-to-reduce-heap-usage-impact-from-visualvm))

	* This story was shared in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]] where they noticed that a company was shifting their behaviours when visited by McKinsey. The consultants were not even hired yet, they were there to propose something, but the entire [[Complex System]] has changed when they observe the visit ([[Observer effect]]).
