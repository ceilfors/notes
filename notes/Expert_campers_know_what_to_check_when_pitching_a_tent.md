# Expert campers know what to check when pitching a tent
When I pitch my tent for the first time, I thought the only thing that I needed to know is how to pitch a tent. Little did I know, on the second camping I went to, we had a slope. I didn't consider this when I pitched the tent, therefore we were rolling around when we slept!

I thought I'd know everything that I need to consider by know, but I was wrong. See reference.

- Pitching your tent next to running water may seem a good idea in the early evening but the sound can become irritating as the night wears on and, if the water level rises, you might get we.
- If you have to pitch on a slope, always sleep with your head at the highest end.
- Pitch your tent so that the entrance  faces away from the wind.
- Peg your tent down roughly before making adjustments to ensure it does not blow away; fix the windward side first.
- Avoid pitching at the bottom of a slope. Water run-off and cold air flowing downhill can spoil a comfortable night; that perfect valley-bottom pitch may be colder than you anticipated in the early hour.
- Do not dig a mini-moat around your tent as it damages the soil and encourages erosion. Take a little time to pick a good level pitch.
- Pitching a tent in a strong wind can test patience and tempers. Lay out pegs and poles ready to and and peg down at least one corner of inner sheet and flysheet to help control flapping fabric and avoid frustrationn or damage.
- Take advantage of natural windbreaks such as hedges or walls, but resist the temptation to 'borrow' stones from dry stone walls. Strong when intact, removing stones affect their stability.
- Advice to avoid pitching under trees usually focuses on the risks of being crushed by a rogue branch. More likely is being irritated by the drip, drip, drip of water on your flysheet long after the rain has stopped. In sunny climes, trees offer welcome shade from the sun, but take local advice before pitching.
