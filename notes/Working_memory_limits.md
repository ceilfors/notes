# Working memory limits
A working memory is a part of our cognitive system where we hold temporary information and process them. There are limits to our working memory:
1. How long we can hold the information
2. How many pieces of information we can hold and process

We can't hold the information in our working memory for more than 30 seconds. There are a couple of answers to how many information we can hold and process. Many references would refer to the number 7 (Miller). A more recent study points that our limit is more like a maximum of 4 (Cowan).

> Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).

> We have a short-term memory that is limited in size to something like seven digits, words, or other units. The only way to hang on to information for a longer time period is to create a more durable representation, either by writing it down or encoding a long-term memory of it.

	* Perhaps, one reason I felt stuck is because there are too many variables I’m playing in my head when I was presented with the architectural problem. I was hitting my [[Working memory limits]]. By writing them down, it’s as if I have more working memory to play with. [[Writing notes makes thinking possible]].
* [[Writing notes makes thinking possible]]
	* We need a good method to think because we have [[Working memory limits]]. If [[Effective tool circumvents human limits]], we need to find a tool that circumvents our working memory limit. The tool, or method of thinking that has been proven by science is note-writing. Many would think that writing helps our thinking, but contemporary handbook of neuroscientists argues that writing is what makes thinking possible. Scientists with different specialisation, like psychologists, educators, or philosophers, may disagree on how our brain works, but most of them agree that real thinking will require a form of writing (Ahrens 95-96).

	* Whether we like or not, we are all constrained by our biological limits. We have [[Working memory limits]], we can’t imagine a five-dimensional cube, and our circadian rhythm will tell our sleep pattern. Even [[Usain Bolt can’t outrun a domestic cat]].
