# Use 4Cs for interviewing
The 4Cs model are useful to remember the skills that you are looking for in a potential hire. The 4Cs are:
* Communication
* Collaboration
* Creativity
* Critical Thinking

When you are hiring remotely, for example, you have to emphasis on communication skill. This includes writing skill and video call.
