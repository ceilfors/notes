# Decomposition

* [[To maximise practice time is to maximise error rates]]
	* Given that she's repeating the whole song each time, this error rate can be increased by [[Decomposition]]. Rather than practising for the whole song, I pin down where she's making the error, and get her to repeat the particular spot (bars) she's making the errors. Repeating the error spots over and over again, she'll increase the error rate to 20 errors/min.
