# Talking while driving is dangerous when the other person can not observe the traffic situation
Once trained, driving utilises [[Automatic processing]], which is why we can talk at the same time.

When traffic is worsened, or there's a potential hazard, we have to switch our attention to the potential hazard and think differently. When this happens, we'll not be able to talk because the hazardous situation has increases our [[Perceptual load]].

When I'm about to park my car, I would get everyone to be quiet in the car, as I need extra focus, including turning off the music.

When the person we're talking to is next to us, they'll be able to pause the conversation so that we can focus on our driving. This makes our driving safer still (unless you have a kid who doesn't know what a potential hazard may look like). 

Unfortunately, when the person we're talking to is on the phone, regardless of whether you're using handsfree, it's still dangerous, because they can't see the potential hazard.
