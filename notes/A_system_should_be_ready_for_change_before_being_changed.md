# A system should be ready for change before being changed
One might make an attempt to change a system and realising that the act is backfiring. The idea of readiness is important as that can be considered as a different state in system that's worth considering. A couple of examples:

- In coaching: Coaching a team member that doesn't want to be coached. The system is not ready, there's no point forcing the coaching to happen. ([[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]])
- In software: [[Make the change easy, then make the easy change]]
- In leadership: When a leader enters a new environment, you want to make communication or checks before making the change.

To understand the readiness of the system, [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]].
