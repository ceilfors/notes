# Failure to influence change may cause burnout
Throughout my career, I have noticed, the top common reason my mentees got burnout is from trying to get their managers/teams to prioritise [[Technical debt]], or improve their codebase in general.

Unfortunately, [[Influencing without authority]] is hard, and the failure to prioritise debts can worsen the situation faster ([[Broken windows accelerates software entropy]]).
