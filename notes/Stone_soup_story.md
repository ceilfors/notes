Two soldiers have just reached a village and were hungry. Unfortunately, no one gave them any foods. They've decided to setup a pot and start cooking a stone.

One Curious villager noticed it, came out and asked what's cooking. The soldiers told the villager that they are cooking a soup, then said, it'll be more delicious if we have more carrots. The villager went home, took some carrots and put that in the pot, then sat down and wait.

Another villager noticed this... And the story repeats.
