# New learnings rarely start from zero
Every new knowledge that we are trying to understand will be based on top of an existing preconception ([[Hermeneutic circle]]) (Ahrens 48). Knowing this as a fact, we should not fear learning something new just because it sounds new. Our previous learning or existing skills are usually transferrable.

The transferability of a skill might not as straightforward as you'd like. You have to broken them down into smaller skills to see the transferable parts. When my 3-year-old was learning how to hold a pen, for example, the transferrable skill she got was from learning how to lace or thread. The transferable part was her fine motor skill.

We, software engineers, could pick up a new programming language easily when we want to. Design patterns are an example of what can be transferred from one programming language to another, even though they are not part of the programming language itself.
