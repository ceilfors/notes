# Personality trait is the pattern of attentional habits
Given there are two people with different personality traits in a party, the extrovert would typically be energised after socialising, while the introvert would normally end up quite exhausted. These two different personality traits differ in how they decide to spend their [[Psychic energy]]. The extrovert has the [[Attentional habits]] to look for enjoyment with others, the introvert decide to spend their energy to avoid danger or being self-conscious all the time.

The extrovert is not tired because the enjoyment they get with others gives them flow experience, and [[Flow experience consumes less energy]]. Yes, having a conversation, even gossiping, is a flow activity as skills are required .

> Socializing might at first sight appear to be an exception to the statement that one needs to use skills to enjoy an activity, for it does not seem that gossiping or joking around with another person requires particular abilities. But of course, it does; as so many shy people know, if a person feels self-conscious, he or she will dread establishing informal contacts, and avoid company whenever possible.
