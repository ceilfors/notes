# Zettels should be optimised for retrieval strength
[[Understanding requires elaboration]], and elaboration is an act of connecting ideas to as many contexts as possible. Connecting new ideas will be difficult if you can't retrieve your previous notes easily. [[Remembering can be improved by deliberately creating cues]], therefore zettels must be optimised for their retrieval by creating more cues. These are the approach that you should take to make them more retrievable:

- [[Zettels should be linked]]. Links provide contextual cues as it'll be included in a sentence. Extra cues are generated when you generate backlinks.
- [[Zettels should capture an atomic concept]]. Not only a well thought concepts are more linkable, they are also more retrievable as the title itself is a cue
- [[Zettels should be tagged]]. Tags are useful as supplementary cues.
