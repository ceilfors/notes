# Workflow trumps willpower
[[Self-control is a good indicator for academic success]], therefore the ability for us to stay in control is important. While willpower is an answer to self-discipline or self-control, willpower is a resource that depletes quickly hence is not a sustainable way to perform the tasks at hand (Ahrens 2). 

Instead of thinking about how we can have better willpower, we need to think about how we can do something without willpower (Ahrens 16), and this can be done by changing our environments. Fortunately, self-control also has much more to do with our environments than ourselves (Ahrens 3). You can't eat chocolates when none are around.

When it comes to creative works, workflow is a way for us to define our environment. [[Well-defined workflow forms positive feedback loop]], hence, not only having a good workflow will help us perform our tasks, but it will also provide a motivational loop for us to continue the tasks.

* [[How to Take Smart Notes]]
	* We need a workflow for note-writing, because [[Workflow trumps willpower]]
* [[Evergreen note-writing enables constant focus on interesting materials]]
	* Focusing just on the interesting things at the moment may sound like a risky approach, where there is a risk to not produce any output. Counterintuitively, the top down approach (where you'll start with a hypotheses and find relevant materials) will pose a greater risk due to the heavy reliance on willpower ([[Workflow trumps willpower]]). Pursuing anything that you'll find interesting at the moment doesn't mean that you'll not produce any output, but you'll have multiple things that are going on in parallel. Producing the output will also be a lot easier that you have collected a lot of materials.
* [[Positive thinking can result in negative outcome]]
	* Unfortunately many people would stop on the imagination step, because it feels good in the short term. In the long term, you will feel demotivated as you wouldn't see any progress, resulting in a negative outcome. This is not to say that positive thinking is bad as it is still a good way to start something, the emphasis here is you should not stop on the imagination step ([[When you know your sickness, you are halfway cured]]). You have to translate them into actions, because [[Workflow trumps willpower]].
