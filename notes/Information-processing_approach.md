	* As there is no single branch of science that deals with how consciousness works, Mihaly simplifies the concept of consciousness by presenting it based on phenomenology (think phenomena, events) and information theory which can be summarised as *intentionally ordered information* (Mihaly 26). He removes the complexity of how consciousness works, and focus from the perspective of the information themselves and how we can direct their course by intent (See: [[Information-processing approach]]).
