# Chunking should be borrowed from experts
[[Limits of working memory may limit improvements from practice]].

[[How might we use our limited working memory capacity more effectively?]] One of the ways to improve our working memory capacity is by [[chunking]].

When I was trying to improve my badminton game, there were many points that I needed to pay attention to:
- Where my opponent are and where my shuttle is going
- Predicting what my opponent is about to do
- Where the shuttle is going to land
- I need to remember to do a split step
- My split step timing needs to be correct
- etc

Given my [[Working memory limits]], I won't be able to pay attention to all of these at the same time. The chunk that I discovered from experts is the word "anticipation".

Given that [[Practicing is an exercise of moving from System 2 to System 1 by rehearsing]], I repeated the word "anticipate anticipate anticipate", and that becomes my all encompassing attention to cover all the points above. It also becomes the word I would recall repeatedly when I practice, carrying the same effect to coaching notes ([[Coaching notes allow students to focus their individual practice]]).

Without an expert knowledge, I wouldn't have discovered this chunk.

Some chunks, such as "error rates", can be detrimental depending on the [[Practice-Perform duality]]. [[Measuring error rates may reduce performance]].
