# Non-linear Causality
## Backlinks
* [[Three systems through complexity science]]
	* Can also be reframed as [[Non-linear Causality]]
* [[Team size and communication lines has non-linear causality]]
	* Adding a new team member will increase cost of communication. You might think that this will have a linear input (team size) and output (communication cost), but it actually has a [[Non-linear Causality]].
* [[Zoozve's orbit can't be predicted]]
	* This is an interesting example of [[Non-linear Causality]], where just by adding one more planet, suddenly astrophysicist can't predict the orbit.
