# Non-linear causality
## Backlinks
* [[Three systems through complexity science]]
	* Can also be reframed as [[Non-linear causality]]
* [[Complex system can't be predicted]]
	* One of the symptom of [[Complex problem assumed ordered]] is to make an attempt to predict a [[Complex system]]. Unfortunately, given that a complex system has a [[Non-linear causality]], it's inherently unpredictable.
* [[Retrospective coherence should not be used for a complex domain]]
	* Due to the [[Non-linear causality]] in a [[Complex system]], it's dangerous to assume that we can use [[Retrospective coherence]].
* [[Team size and communication lines has non-linear causality]]
	* Adding a new team member will increase cost of communication. You might think that this will have a linear input (team size) and output (communication cost), but it actually has a [[Non-linear causality]].
