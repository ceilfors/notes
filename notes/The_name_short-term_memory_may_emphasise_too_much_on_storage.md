# The name short-term memory may emphasise too much on storage
The idea of [[Short-term memory]] which was initially introduced in the [[Atkison-Shiffrin Memory Model]] didn't manage to capture the importance of what the memory is being used for. I think researches during that time studies more about the storage aspect of this memory, such as how many info can we stored inside, how long will the info live, etc.

Baddeley later introduced the idea of [[Working memory]] to broaden the role and concept of this memory so that it captures the dynamic process of a working memory because this memory is not only used for storing, but we are actively manipulate and process the information.

* [[Working memory]]
	* See also [[The name short-term memory may emphasise too much on storage]], therefore working memory is introduced.
* [[Information in memory is being represented not stored]]
	* In the book [[Goldstein, Cognitive Psychology]], the author is being very careful in using the word represented, rather than stored, when talking about the [[Long-term memory]]. This is due to the similar concern of [[The name short-term memory may emphasise too much on storage]]. Information in our memory is not stored as-is, and it may be different when you recall it in the future.
