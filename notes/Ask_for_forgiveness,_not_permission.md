# Ask for forgiveness, not permission
This is a quote from Grace Hopper. This is one way to [[Influencing without authority]].

This is also one of the many principles that stuck in my head when I worked for ThoughtWorks. The idea is if you have a good idea, rather than asking for a permission, which normally takes a long time to be reviewed, do it anyway.

When you do it anyway, there are 2 potential outcomes:
1. People don't agree with what you've done: Ask for forgiveness
2. People agree with what you've done
