# Web usability is achieved by designing for the intended attention types
[[Only one type of attention can be given to one thing at one time]], and this is a constraint that should be considered to make usable websites.

Users will usually come into a website looking for something. In this scenario, users will be using the playful attention type, therefore the web pages should be designed for scanning ([[Websites should be designed for scanning]]).

Once users have found what they are looking for, they will usually be required to spend an effort, like filling a form, for example. In this scenario, users will be using the analytical attention type, therefore the web pages should help the users focus ([[Websites should be designed to allow focus]]).

## Backlinks
* [[Usable websites require less psychic energy to be used]]
	* This is why [[Web usability is achieved by designing for the intended attention types]]. Adding long instructions, for example, will drain the users energy unnecessarily ([[Self-evident websites do not need instructions]]).
