# Cognitive revolution were inspired by digital computers
I found this to be an interesting phenomenon as our mind ([[The mind]]) is something that our ancestors have been using for a long time, but we don't really understand it, until psychologists were inspired by how digital computer works, which are things that we invent later. This seemed to have a similar theme to [[Use of innovations often precedes understanding]].
