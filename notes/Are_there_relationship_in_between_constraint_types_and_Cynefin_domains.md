# Are there relationship in between constraint types and Cynefin domains?
There are conflicting information around how the idea of [[Types of constraints]] and [[Cynefin domains]] are related to each other.

From [Constraints | Cynefin Wiki](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Constraints)
> * The Clear domain is associated with Rigid constraints
> * The Complicated domain is associated with Governing constraints
> * The Complex domain is associated with Enabling constraints
> * The Chaotic domain is associated with the absence of constraints

From [Constraints | Cynefin Wiki](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Constraints)
> Note these should not be seen as exclusive but complementary in a number of cases, for example governing constraints in the Clear domain are also likely to highly rigid and have low permeability.

The latter suggests that in a Clear domain, a governing constraint can also be applied.

This is my understanding so far on what "associated" means:
1. It's not about what constraints should be applied to which domain. Rather, I should think about, what's the current constraints at play? The association is more about what's currently effective (what's causing an effect to the system).
2. It's a constraint that's dominantly playing in a domain. It doesn't mean other constraints are not at play, they're less dominant.
