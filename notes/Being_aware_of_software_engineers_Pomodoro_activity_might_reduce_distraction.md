# Being aware of software engineers Pomodoro activity might reduce distraction
[[Flow experience]] is an important dimension from [[The Three Dimensions of DevEx]] for software engineer productivity.

Unfortunately, software engineers are frequently distracted by their colleagues, see: [[Example relationship of perceptual load and distraction in software engineering]].

Connection: Handsfree doesn't reduce danger in talking while driving. [[Talking while driving is dangerous when the other person can not observe the traffic situation]].

Having the ability to know what our colleagues are currently doing, whether they're activating their Pomodoro timer, might so that they don't get distracted.
