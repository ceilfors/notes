# Humans can behave as any of the three systems
There are three systems ([[Three systems through complexity science]]). Where does human system sit according to these three definition?

Due to [[Anthro-Complexity]], human can actually behave in any of it:
- Complex system
  - Tend to the default. Social networks.
- Ordered system:
  - Think of an operating theatre where everyone behave like machines with clear roles (First heard from [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]])
- Chaotic system
  - Political revolution?
