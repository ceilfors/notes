> ABRAMS: And then the third is know how you're going to get it. It is important to make a plan. I try things that are guaranteed to fail at least half the time, but I know ambition and dreams without a plan, it's just a wish. So I think about it. I write it down. I figure out what are the steps. And I've been not only chastised for being too ambitious; I've been called too calculating. But, particularly, when you come from a place where people don't expect of you, that also means they don't teach you how.
