* [[Complex problem assumed ordered]]
	* One of the most common mistake is to think that we're operating in an [[Ordered system]], while we're actually in a [[Complex system]].
	* There's a tendency to also finding a silver bullet when you assume [[Ordered system]].
* [[Complex system should be probed to reveal its dispositional state]]
	* Unlike [[Ordered system]], [[Complex system]] can't be analysed for solution. An easier way to navigate a [[Complex system]] to probe then understand its [[Dispositionality]] ([[Probe-Sense-Respond]]).
* [[Solving puzzles vs shifting patterns]]
	* Solve puzzles for [[Ordered system]]
