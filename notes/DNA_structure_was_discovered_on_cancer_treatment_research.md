# DNA structure was discovered on cancer treatment research
The DNA structure was discovered by scientists who were supposed to do a research on a cancer treatment. This wouldn't have happened if the project does not allow the scientists to follow a different path i.e. sticking to the plan.

[[Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes]] (p. 138).
> The beginning of the research project that led to the discovery of DNA's structure was the application for a grant. The grant was not to discover DNA's structure, but find a treatment for cancer. If the scientists had stuck to their promises, not only would they probably not have found a cure for cancer, but they definitely would not have discovered the structure of DNA. Most likely, they would have lost interest in their work. Luckily, they did not stick to their plan, but followed their intuition and interest and took the most promising path to insight whenever one opened up. The actual research program developed along the way (Rheinberger 1997).

* [[Zettelkasten disregards planning]]
	* Sticking to a plan, however, requires willpower (Ahrens 6) and willpower is not a sustainable way to writing, especially when what you write takes a multi year of research ([[Workflow trumps willpower]]); you want to gain enjoyment from writing instead, and [[Zettelkasten enables constant focus on interesting materials]]. We have [[Overconfidence bias]] too which means our plan tend not to work out as we expected. Sticking to a plan will also disregard new discoveries (Ahrens 11). The DNA structure won't be discovered if the scientists sticked to their plan ([[DNA structure was discovered on cancer treatment research]]).
