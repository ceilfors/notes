# Traffic congestion as an example of granularity
I first understood the idea of [[Granularity]] and how useful it is through examples provided in [[Cynefin Basecamp Nov 2023]].

Given a challenge of a traffic congestion, you can scan the problem through different level of granularity. When I first thought about traffic congestion, the first thought I had is all about traffic control system.

But, when you start to scan better, you found that housing system may also affect the congestion.

Further granularity, you can also find that AirBnB may affect traffic congestion.
