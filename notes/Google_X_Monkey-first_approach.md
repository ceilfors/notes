# Google X Monkey-first approach
The 'X' team in Google, who were specialised in executing impossible missions have a practice called the monkey first approach.

It goes like this: Given that we have an idea to get a monkey to recite Shakespeare on a pedestal, it's probably a mistake to work on the pedestal first, and leaving the hard problem last (training the monkey to speak).
