# Production blocking
Production blocking is the tendency for one individual to block other people during a group discussion. In a group of five people, for example, when one person is talking about their ideas, the other four people are blocked. The four people will have to listen to the one person talking, therefore they will not be able to come up with new ideas, or they would merely forget about their ideas. If the five people are able to communicate their ideas at the same time, ironically that may indicate that the group members haven't been listening to each other (a different form of production blocking). 

Production blocking is one of the reason why a brainstorming session, especially the interactive ones, might produce less creative ideas. To make a brainstorming session generate more ideas, thoughts must be able to be shared without an interaction with other group members. This would normally come in a form of writing.

> Generally people in interactive, brainstorming groups produce fewer ideas and ones that are less creative than those same people would if they were working individually, in what is known as nominal groups. Production blocking, the tendency for one individual during a group discussion to block or inhibit other people from offering ideas, is a major reason.
