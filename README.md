Hello. You've stumbled upon my brain extension. All these notes are written for myself,
but I'm sharing them publicly as it might be beneficial for someone out there. You may find it
hard to read as I didn't write it to be read by other people. If you want to browse around,
use the search box at the top of the page. And if you found a broken link, that's because
I haven't written a page for that particular concept, or it's still highly drafty.

_This page is hugely inspired by [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
notes, where I have been learning a lot from_
