We can distract from argumentative gaps with confident gestures or drop a casual &quot;you know what I mean&quot; irrespective of whether we know what we meant.

And before you now wonder if it would be a good idea to overcome the limitations of brainstorming by assembling a group of friends to brainstorm together, forget it: More people in a brainstorming group usually come up with less good ideas and restrict themselves inadvertently to a narrower range of topics (Mullen, Johnson, and Salas 1991). p.134</p></blockquote> <ul><li>This can be counterreacted</li> <li>Is workshop only useful because...

Basically that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle.&quot; - p48</li> <li>This is a very interesting concept. Basically some says: if you want to understand a whole, you have to understand its parts, to understand its parts, you have to understand a whole.

The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions&quot;.

Working with the slip-box means playing with ideas and looking out for interesting connections and comparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clusters and preparing the order of notes for a project. Here, we need to puzzle with notes and find the best fit. It is much more associative, playful and creative than the other tasks and require a very different kind of attention as well.&quot; p62</li></ul></li> <li>&quot;In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed.&quot; p63

When is the right context to have a hypothesis? Does Cynefin help?</li> <li>&quot;The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually no even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. P79</li> <li>&quot;If on were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasons that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration&quot; (Nickerson 198, 175) - p79</li> <li>Zettelkasten reverses this notion, you find argument to support something, not finding the argument to support the other thing</li> <li>Best scientist are not free from it, the counter this by &quot;acknowledging&quot; that they are aware and they do something about it

Start with hypothesis ... is a surefire way to let information bias run rampant&quot; p80</li> <li>Reflecting back, it seems like when we start a product development with a hypotheses, not only we'll have confirmation bias, but we'll have a sunk cost fallacy as we'll start the development in parallel.
<ul><li>There are many things in product development that utilises hypothesis, like LVT, or lean start up</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p>write what you read</p> <ul><li>&quot;Re-reading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. Not op of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989).&quot; p86</li> <li>&quot;We will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgable while in reality staging as dumb as we were. This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing&quot; p86</li> <li>&quot;We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.&quot; p86</li></ul></li> <li><p>Learning requires deliberate practice</p> <ul><li>&quot;It requires effort&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Trying to skip this step would be like going to the gym and trying to work out with the least effort possible.

<ul><li>A clear structure , artist, Lucio Fontana, cut into the canvas instead of painting it.
<ul><li>It is not even true that a more complex structure provides more possibilities. Quite the contrary. The binary code is radically more limited than the alphabet, it contains one zero... etc</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><blockquote><p>The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas -- p131</p></blockquote> <ul><li><blockquote><p>One thing is for sure: the common idea that we should liberate ourselves from any restrictions and &quot;open ourselves up&quot; to be more creative is very misleading indeed (Dean 213, 201) - 132</p></blockquote></li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p>When is it a good idea to defer, and when is it a good idea to start small?</p> <ul><li>If we start a product development by applying all the things that we know, it might be a waste.</li> <li>It seems like things that require practices, need to be started early, but things that can be scanned by robot, does not.</li> <li>Practices are things that we have to question ourself every time, &quot;Is this important?&quot; Is this test important?</li> <li>This is similar to the idea of how to take smart notes
<ul><li><blockquote><p>We don't need to worry about the question of what to write about because we have answered the question already - many times on a daily basis. Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not. -- p134</p></blockquote></li> <li><blockquote><p>If we accompany every step of our with the question, &quot;What is interesting about this? &quot; and everything we read with the question, &quot;What is so relevant about this that is it is worth nothing down?&quot; We do not just choose information according to our interest -- p137</p></blockquote></li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p>Software estimation doesn't work due to overconfidence bias</p> <ul><li>the whole story at p142, where students estimation on when they'll finish their paper is always wrong</li> <li>This has been cracked in the software industry though, where you have to break things down into something smaller.
<ul><li>&quot;Just break it down&quot; -- more motivational, estimatable, progress, etc</li></ul></li> <li>(Buehler, Griffin and Ross 1994)</li> <li>Even the people who study this phenomenon, which is called the overconfidence bias, admit that they too fall for it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff)</li></ul></li> <li><p>Do we need literature notes?</p> <ul><li>More explanation at p24 and convention at p30</li> <li>Since we are capturing evergreen notes with references section already, literature notes seems optional</li> <li>Andy Matuschak's thoughts: <a
