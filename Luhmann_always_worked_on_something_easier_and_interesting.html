The amount of writing he had written is not only a matter of quantity, but of quality as well. Luhmann's &quot;The Society of Society&quot; was so radical that not only it changed sociology, but stirred debate in philosophy, education, political theory, and psychology as well (Ahrens 14).</p> <p>Despite the abnormally impressive productivity that Luhmann demonstrated, he never did anything that he thought was not interesting (Ahrens 15). From his interview:</p> <blockquote><p>I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it, if I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.</p></blockquote> <p>What is &quot;something else&quot; in Luhmann's world? If he's stuck, he would switch context and write on something easier (Ahrens 141). From his interview:</p> <blockquote><p>Well, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any blockages.</p></blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="references"><a href="#references" class="header-anchor">#</a> References</h2> <p>Ahrens, Sönke. <em>How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers</em>. CreateSpace, 2017 (p. 14).</p> <blockquote><p>When he finished the final chapter, almost exactly 29 and a half years later, as a two-volume book with the title of &quot;The Society of Society&quot; (1997), it stirred up the scientific community. It was a radical new theory that not only changed sociology, but stirred heated discussions in philosophy, education, political theory and psychology as well. Not everyone was able to follow the discussions, though. What he did was unusually sophisticated, very different and highly complex.</p></blockquote> <p>Ahrens, Sönke. <em>How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers</em>. CreateSpace, 2017 (p. 15).</p> <blockquote><p>He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn't feel like, he even said: &quot;I only do what is easy.

When he was asked what else he did when he was stuck, his answer was: &quot;Well, writing other books [...]&quot; (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125-55)</p></blockquote> <p>Link to the interview (Ahrens 16 footnote): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRSCKSPMuDc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niklas Luhmann - Beobachter im Krähennest (eng sub) - YouTube<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="backlinks"><a href="#backlinks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Backlinks</h2> <ul><li><a href="./Slow-motion_multitasking.html">Slow-motion multitasking</a> <ul><li>Niklas Luhmann has also demonstrated pattern where it took him 29.5 years to finally publish &quot;The Society of Society&quot;, whilst working on other ideas simultaneously in his slip-box.
