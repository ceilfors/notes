If <a href="./Effective_tool_circumvents_human_limits.html">Effective tool circumvents human limits</a>, we need to find a tool that circumvents our working memory limit. The tool, or method of thinking that has been proven by science is note-writing. Many would think that writing helps our thinking, but contemporary handbook of neuroscientists argues that writing is what makes thinking possible. Scientists with different specialisation, like psychologists, educators, or philosophers, may disagree on how our brain works, but most of them agree that real thinking will require a form of writing (Ahrens 95-96).</p> <p>When there are too many variables that we're thinking about, note-writing let go of some of the variables (like remembering information), so that we can focus on the real thinking (like connecting ideas or understanding) (Ahrens 90).</p> <hr> <h2 id="references"><a href="#references" class="header-anchor">#</a> References</h2> <p>Ahrens, Sönke. <em>How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers</em>.

If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.</p></blockquote> <p>Ahrens, Sönke. <em>How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking: For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers</em>.

Thinking and understanding is what it can't take off your shoulders, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work.
